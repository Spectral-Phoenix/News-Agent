      "title": "Asana introduces ‘AI teammates’ designed to work alongside human employees",
      "content": "By now most people have heard of AI agents — software that can act autonomously to undertake a series of tasks, but Asana has decided to take a different approach when it comes to AI. The company on Wednesday introduced a beta of what it’s calling “AI teammates” in a bid to help move work inside an organization.\n\nPaige Costello, head of AI at Asana, said the company chose the name deliberately to create a mental shift in terms of how people think of interacting with AI at work. “We believe that the future of work is humans not just working with humans, but humans also working with AI,” Costello told TechCrunch.\n\n“And we believe in that world, that it’s going to be just as important to understand what you asked the AI to do, what it did and how much it cost to make that happen.”\n\nCostello said it’s about creating transparency and structure around the AI so that businesses can specify and create customized assistants to execute core parts of workflows.\n\nIt sounds good, but what does this look like in practice? According to Costello, the previous generation of workflow tools were rigidly defined, and what separates today’s announcement (and generative AI in general) is that it provides a more flexible way to move work inside a company.\n\nSo as work comes in, the AI could evaluate the current state and determine if it’s ready to move to the next step, or if it needs to return the work to a human to add more information before it can continue. For example, if a help ticket comes in with a missing or inadequate description, the AI teammate could send it back to the person who submitted the ticket, asking for what it needs. That could involve using generative AI to help the human employee write the ticket before sending it on to the AI teammate, which can then direct the ticket to the right person for resolution.\n\nAsana clearly has a treasure trove of data related to how work moves inside a company to train its models, thanks to its work graph, which models how work is connected between individuals and departments. But while this all sounds good, we know that AI agents can still hallucinate, and they don’t always understand the nature of an activity.\n\n“The work graph enables us to tell AI not just how work happens, but how work happens in this specific instance. So when we embed AI teammates into a particular workflow, they’re given a specific job to do. When they have that specific job, and they know what information to read, they’re much more likely to do the right things,” Costello said.\n\nBut Costello acknowledged that Asana is encouraging its customers to keep humans involved, because it recognizes that the AI isn’t always going to get it right. “I would say that a core principle we have about AI at Asana is ‘human in the loop.’ We believe that, ultimately, humans are responsible for decisions and they’re accountable for results,” she said.\n\nThat means humans need to be able to supervise and inspect the AI to make sure it’s making sound recommendations in line with the company’s values and way of working.\n\nTo solve for this, Asana has been looking for workflows where it has been able to achieve a high degree of accuracy. “We have found that we’re able to embed AI teammates to remove a lot of administrative work and tracking work within these systems very quickly, with high degrees of success. We’re also effectively able to use dynamic variables to retrieve information about the work and about the systems in the context of work,” she said.\n\nAll that said, this tooling is still in beta, and it will likely involve some growing pains, especially when companies try to move beyond experimentation and implement it at scale. But if data is the key to building more accurate models, an organization with insight into how companies work, like Asana does, could have a better chance than most of successfully helping move work through a series of steps in a more intelligent way.",

      "title": "Cartwheel generates 3D animations from scratch to power up creators",
      "content": "Animating a 3D character from scratch is generally both laborious and expensive, requiring the use of complex software and motion capture tools. Cartwheel wants to make basic animations as simple as describing them, generating a basic movement with AI and letting creators focus on more expressive tasks.\n\n“There hasn’t been a lot of new stuff in animation since I started doing it,” said Jonathan Jarvis, co-founder and CEO of the startup and an animator himself. “There’s a big ‘blank screen’ problem, where there’s a million buttons and options. Sometimes you’ll spend hours working on something before you even see what it looks like.”\n\nCartwheel is intended to skip that first step, going from zero to basic movement, so animators who want to create a scene or character don’t have to spend so much time on elementary motions like taking a step, swatting a fly or sitting down.\n\n“We help generate a motion you would get from a motion capture setup, or keying it [i.e. animating via keyframe] yourself, just a lot faster. There’s a lot of value in just quickly getting it out of your head and moving. Then you can take it and tweak it,” Jarvis said.\n\nThe interface is deliberately simple, just a character and a text box. You can write just about anything in there, and in a minute or two you’ll have a basic but fluid animation that you can then export to any normal 3D editing suite.\n\nYou can also check out live 3D examples on their site, like this boxing one or a little dude doing a solo waltz.\n\nThe model they built is totally original, said co-founder Andrew Carr, also the company’s chief scientist.\n\n“We have multiple data sources, all ethically sourced, and our own labelers labeling these motions,” he explained. “Motion is represented as a matrix — this is well-known in the literature — a matrix with poses, time, velocity and so on. So you associate the motion matrix with a text description of the motion, and do pretty standard training on motion-language pairs, the same way you’d generate images or video.”\n\nImage Credits: Cartwheel\n\nThe animations you get are “on average about 80% of the way there,” Carr estimated. Jarvis said it can produce impressive, professional-level results, “and sometimes it’s a miss.” But it’s immensely faster and simpler than a traditional animation workflow, especially in environments where you have multiple artists working on one process and even small tweaks have to go up and down the line.\n\nThe models they use aren’t even that big, meaning they’re cheaper to run and could conceivably be locally hosted.\n\n“Actually, this is really cool,” Carr said. “For a video model, you’re predicting 2,000×2,000 pixels, every frame for 60 frames per second … that’s just such a massive thing it has to wrangle. What we’re predicting is an order of magnitude or more smaller; it can run on the CPU, or older GPUs, and we can train models faster.”\n\nCartwheel co-founders Jonathan Jarvis (left) and Andrew Carr. Image Credits: Cartwheel\n\nJarvis even suggested they might eventually be able to render new or modified animations on the fly, a holy grail for interactivity in games, where characters are generally limited to a set of canned movements and dialogue lines. Things like camera movements and angles can also be intuitively described, and non-human characters are in the pipe as well — though the startup is first focused on human animations, since they’re by far the most commonly required.\n\nIt’s reminiscent in a way of how Wonder Dynamics greatly simplified the process of 3D character insertion, with a focus not on replacing animators or artists but on skipping the repetitive drudgery of elementary animation work. The industry as a whole has embraced AI-adjacent tools as time savers that let their creatives focus more on creation; certainly Autodesk has, at any rate, as shown by its acquisition of Wonder Dynamics two weeks ago.\n\nIt may be a little unseemly to speculate about the ultimate fate of a startup right as it’s starting up, but Cartwheel could conceivably go the same way: snapped up as a promising and powerful feature that could prove an advantage over competitors. But it could also build itself up as an platform-agnostic tool and offer a growing suite of services to professional animators.\n\nEither way, it has secured its first round of funding, a $5.6 million seed led by by Accel, with participation by Khosla Ventures, Human Ventures, Heretic VC, MVP Ventures, Correlation Ventures, and Pelion VC — and a handful of angels, as is tradition.\n\nFor now Cartwheel is happy to act as one of the many prosumer type apps that animators rely on to do their work. You can test it yourself if you sign up for the beta.\n\n“There’s this notion of AI replacing creative work, and as someone who does creative work, it’s like, no! This leads to more animation, more motion, one person doing more,” Jarvis said. “And that will eventually go up the stack to the big studios that will be doing incredible stuff we haven’t even thought of. But between the Pixars and the people playing on their phones, there’s a whole bunch of levels, and that’s where a lot of the creative work really gets done.”",

      "content": "Alphabet on Wednesday said it has hired pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly’s CFO, Anat Ashkenazi, as its finance head.\n\nThe appointment comes nearly a year after Alphabet confirmed that its current CFO, Ruth Porat, would leave the post. Porat, who joined the company (then known as Google) from Morgan Stanley in 2015, will move into a new role: president and chief investment officer of Alphabet and Google.\n\nAshkenazi will start her new role at Google’s parent company on July 31, according to an SEC filing today, after 23 years at Eli Lilly, where she served in various roles until landing the CFO role in 2021. Eli Lilly also separately said that Ashkenazi had resigned, writing that she intends to remain in the position through July.\n\nAlphabet is obviously an entirely different business than Eli Lilly, which is known for pharmaceuticals such as clinical depression and diabetes drugs, but Eli Lilly is an $800 billion company in its own right, so the step over is not going to be Herculean. Plus, Alphabet already has existing alignments with the healthcare and life science sectors through its subsidiaries such as Verily and Calico.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Alphabet has spun out an AI-enabled drug-discovery company called Isomorphic Labs, founded by DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis. Earlier this year, Isomorphic Labs inked a strategic deal with Eli Lilly (and Novartis) to help apply AI to drug R&D.\n\nAshkenazi will be based in the Bay Area and will report directly to Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\n“We’re very pleased to have found such a strong CFO, with a track record of strategic focus on long-term investment to fuel innovation and growth,” Pichai said in a statement. “The AI era is giving us an incredible opportunity to innovate at scale across our core products, and to create entirely new products and experiences for our users and customers. I look forward to working with Anat as we invest responsibly to support our next wave of growth.”",

      "title": "Whizz wants to own the delivery e-bike subscription space, starting with NYC",
      "content": "New York City, home to over 60,000 gig delivery workers, has been cracking down on cheap, uncertified e-bikes that have resulted in battery fires across the city.\n\nSome e-bike providers may see such regulations as a problem for business. But e-bike subscription startup Whizz sees it as an opportunity.\n\n“I think the market is moving from a Wild West to a mature market,” Mike Peregudov, CEO and co-founder at Whizz, told TechCrunch. “We’re lucky to be here in this moment because after all the regulations happen, it will be very hard to enter this market.”\n\nThe New York-based startup claims to offer gig workers access to safe, high-quality e-bikes for between $139 and $149 per month. Couriers for Grubhub and DoorDash, Whizz’s official partners in NYC, can access subscriptions and rent-to-own schemes for 15% off. Subscriptions include service, maintenance, anti-theft protection and more.\n\nFounded in 2022, Whizz this week raised $12 million to build more e-bikes, begin producing e-mopeds and expand beyond New York to other cities, including Boston, Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. The round was broken into $5 million in equity led by Leta Capital and $7 million in debt from Flashpoint VC.\n\nUltimately, Whizz wants to launch nationwide. In the short-term, the startup aims to manage 40,000 e-bikes in the NYC area over the next three years, up from the 2,500 e-bikes Whizz currently has deployed across NYC and Jersey City.\n\nThere are few players in the e-bike subscription space in the U.S. Whizz’s main competitor is Zoomo, an Australian startup with a presence in NYC and a handful of European cities. Zoomo’s subscription costs, on average, are about $49 per week or just under $200 per month. Uber Eats couriers get a better deal at $24 per week, or just under $100 per month. Zoomo also works with enterprise customers to provide entire fleets.\n\nThe lack of disruption in the e-bike subscription arena could mean that Whizz is in a perfect position to get a first-mover advantage. Or it could mean that the e-bike subscription model is difficult to get right.\n\nOther consumer-facing micromobility subscriptions in NYC have come and gone, like Beyond’s e-scooter rental offering and charging infrastructure company Revel’s attempt at an e-bike subscription. And as we’ve seen from the many failures of shared micromobility companies like Bird and Superpedestrian, hardware-as-a-service (HaaS) is a high-capital expenditure business. That doesn’t always square up to the most attractive aspect of subscriptions: an affordable price point. The combination of the two opposing forces often translates to unimpressive margins.\n\nOn the other hand, subscriptions have the benefit of repeat revenue, which can be leveraged to improve margins as long as a company keeps operations lean and efficient.\n\nWhizz says this is where it can shine. The startup has relied on its proprietary software that streamlines operations and a culture of bootstrapping to grow 3.5x year-over-year and reach an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of more than $8 million as of May. ARR is a projection of revenue for the year based on current and expected customer numbers.\n\nPeregudov also says Whizz will be EBITDA positive in two to three months and fully profitable within nine months.\n\nThe CEO and his co-founders all came to New York from Russia a few years ago after founding and selling subscription-based businesses. Peregudov built Partiya Edy, a meal-kit delivery service, and sold it to Yandex in 2019 for $25 million. His co-founders — Alex Mironov, Ksenia Proka, and Artem Serbovka — built and sold an e-bike subscription platform, Moy Device, to a private equity firm in Russia.\n\n“We never raised hundreds of millions, and I think in this type of business, that could be dangerous,” Peregudov said. “We’ve seen companies that have raised $100 million and then they try to blitzscale. This business is not about blitzscaling.”\n\nUsing software to improve unit economics\n\nWhizz’s software manages the back end to help the e-bike subscription startup achieve strong unit economics. Image Credits: Whizz\n\nPeregudov says the most important part of Whizz’s business is its proprietary “enterprise resource management” (ERP) system, the software that powers the back end and protects Whizz’s assets. The CEO says this software helps Whizz cut costs by 35%, achieve a 85% fleet utilization rate and “improve margins at every step.”\n\nThe software provides analytics on everything from how much time it takes to complete a repair to how IoT can help manage warehouse logistics, from information on all bikes and customers in the system to revenue and payments management. Whizz’s system can even remotely control parts of the bikes to brick them if they get stolen.\n\nAnother aspect of Whizz’s software is its internal scoring model, which the startup uses to ensure it’s renting bikes to responsible people. “This scoring system is AI-enabled with more than 50 parameters, and it’s like a bank credit score,” Peregudov said. “These guys are mostly immigrants, and we are probably the only company on the market that can score them because banks don’t do that. That’s why these guys don’t have credit scores. Our bikes are often the only option for affordable transportation for them.”\n\nQuality e-bikes, batteries and service\n\nWhizz co-founders (left to right): Alex Mironov, Artem Serbovka, Ksenia Proka, and Mike Peregudov Image Credits: Whizz\n\nWhizz’s e-bikes are also designed in-house specifically to service food delivery workers. Peregudov claims the bikes are reliable enough to ride for up to 1,000 miles per month and have large batteries to enable couriers to drive more, and thus, earn more. The batteries, he says, are UL certified and built with Samsung cells.\n\nGig workers in NYC can visit one of Whizz’s five hubs to pick up bikes and have them repaired or replaced in 30 minutes or less. The hubs are located in Midtown, Union Square, Harlem and Brooklyn, with a fifth coming this week to Jersey City.\n\nWhizz also says it offers customer service in six languages: English, Spanish, French, Turkish, Arabic and Russian.\n\nThe major snag in Whizz’s future plans is the fact that its bikes and batteries are all assembled in China. The Biden administration recently announced new tariffs on Chinese imports, including e-bikes and batteries, which will be subject to a 25% price hike. Peregudov says he’s not worried because Whizz owns its IP and can move production to a new partner in India or Vietnam.\n\nCan Whizz’s model scale across the U.S.?\n\nWhile the e-bike subscription market geared at gig delivery workers is still new, it’s not a guarantee that Whizz will be able to scale in the U.S. Zoomo, the incumbent, as it were, has a respectable presence in Europe, but its market share in the U.S. has recently shrunk. The startup used to offer its services in San Francisco, but shuttered there in 2022. Zoomo did not respond to TechCrunch to explain what went wrong.\n\nWhizz’s strategy for expansion is twofold: Work its way down the East Coast before expanding nationally, and offer new form factors to reach a broader range of delivery workers.\n\nWhizz’s latest funding round will help get the company part of the way by taking more territory in NYC and building a new e-moped. In the long run, the startup sees itself even potentially bringing EVs onto the platform for delivery workers who don’t live in bike-friendly cities, which are few and far between in the U.S.\n\nSergey Toporov, a partner at Leta Capital who led Whizz’s equity round, said he invested in the startup because it was able to achieve a great contribution margin on a small scale.\n\nToporov noted that Leta mainly invests in software companies, so Whizz’s ERP system is what appealed the most because it will help the company stay efficient and organized as it scales its fleet, customers and employee base and brings on new types of vehicles.\n\n“The hype around micromobility and fast delivery has passed, and most VCs have pivoted to other industries. However, we strive to focus on companies with fundamental business value in the markets not inflated by an excess of capital,” Toporov said. “We believe that Whizz is a hidden gem that will continue to surprise the market.”",

      "title": "Hundreds of Snowflake customer passwords found online are linked to info-stealing malware",
      "content": "Cloud data analysis company Snowflake is at the center of a recent spate of alleged data thefts, as its corporate customers scramble to understand if their stores of cloud data have been compromised.\n\nThe Boston-based data giant helps some of the largest global corporations — including banks, healthcare providers and tech companies — store and analyze their vast amounts of data, such as customer data, in the cloud.\n\nLast week, Australian authorities sounded the alarm saying they had become aware of “successful compromises of several companies utilising Snowflake environments,” without naming the companies. Hackers had claimed on a known cybercrime forum that they had stolen hundreds of millions of customer records from Santander Bank and Ticketmaster, two of Snowflake’s biggest customers. Santander confirmed a breach of a database “hosted by a third-party provider,” but would not name the provider in question. On Friday, Live Nation confirmed that its Ticketmaster subsidiary was hacked and that the stolen database was hosted on Snowflake.\n\nSnowflake acknowledged in a brief statement that it was aware of “potentially unauthorized access” to a “limited number” of customer accounts, without specifying which ones, but that it has found no evidence there was a direct breach of its systems. Rather, Snowflake called it a “targeted campaign directed at users with single-factor authentication” and that the hackers used “previously purchased or obtained through infostealing malware,” which is designed to scrape a user’s saved passwords from their computer.\n\nDespite the sensitive data that Snowflake holds for its customers, Snowflake lets each customer manage the security of their environments, and does not automatically enroll or require its customers to use multi-factor authentication, or MFA, according to Snowflake’s customer documentation. Not enforcing the use of MFA appears to be how cybercriminals allegedly obtained huge amounts of data from some of Snowflake’s customers, some of which set up their environments without the additional security measure.\n\nSnowflake conceded that one of its own “demo” accounts was compromised because it wasn’t protected beyond a username and password, but claimed the account “did not contain sensitive data.” It’s unclear if this stolen demo account has any role in the recent breaches.\n\nTechCrunch has this week seen hundreds of alleged Snowflake customer credentials that are available online for cybercriminals to use as part of hacking campaigns, suggesting that the risk of Snowflake customer account compromises may be far wider than first known.\n\nThe credentials were stolen by infostealing malware that infected the computers of employees who have access to their employer’s Snowflake environment.\n\nSome of the credentials seen by TechCrunch appear to belong to employees at companies known to be Snowflake customers, including Ticketmaster and Santander, among others. The employees with Snowflake access include database engineers and data analysts, some of whom reference their experience using Snowflake on their LinkedIn pages.\n\nFor its part, Snowflake has told customers to immediately switch on MFA for their accounts. Until then, Snowflake accounts that aren’t enforcing the use of MFA to log in are putting their stored data at risk of compromise from simple attacks like password theft and reuse.\n\nHow we checked the data\n\nA source with knowledge of cybercriminal operations pointed TechCrunch to a website where would-be attackers can search through lists of credentials that have been stolen from various sources, such as infostealing malware on someone’s computer or collated from previous data breaches. (TechCrunch is not linking to the site where stolen credentials are available so as not to aid bad actors.)\n\nIn all, TechCrunch has seen more than 500 credentials containing employee usernames and passwords, along with the web addresses of the login pages for the corresponding Snowflake environments.\n\nThe exposed credentials appear to pertain to Snowflake environments belonging to Santander, Ticketmaster, at least two pharmaceutical giants, a food delivery service, a public-run freshwater supplier, and others. We have also seen exposed usernames and passwords allegedly belonging to a former Snowflake employee.\n\nTechCrunch is not naming the former employee because there’s no evidence they did anything wrong. (It’s ultimately both the responsibility of Snowflake and its customers to implement and enforce security policies that prevent intrusions that result from the theft of employee credentials.)\n\nWe did not test the stolen usernames and passwords as doing so would break the law. As such, it’s unknown if the credentials are currently in active use or if they directly led to account compromises or data thefts. Instead, we worked to verify the authenticity of the exposed credentials in other ways. This includes checking the individual login pages of the Snowflake environments that were exposed by the infostealing malware, which were still active and online at the time of writing.\n\nThe credentials we’ve seen include the employee’s email address (or username), their password, and the unique web address for logging in to their company’s Snowflake environment. When we checked the web addresses of the Snowflake environments — often made up of random letters and numbers — we found the listed Snowflake customer login pages are publicly accessible, even if not searchable online.\n\nTechCrunch confirmed that the Snowflake environments correspond to the companies whose employees’ logins were compromised. We were able to do this because each login page we checked had two separate options to sign in.\n\nOne way to login relies on Okta, a single sign-on provider that allows Snowflake users to sign in with their own company’s corporate credentials using MFA. In our checks, we found that these Snowflake login pages redirected to Live Nation (for Ticketmaster) and Santander sign-in pages. We also found a set of credentials belonging to a Snowflake employee, whose Okta login page still redirects to an internal Snowflake login page that no longer exists.\n\nSnowflake’s other login option allows the user to use only their Snowflake username and password, depending on whether the corporate customer enforces MFA on the account, as detailed by Snowflake’s own support documentation. It’s these credentials that appear to have been stolen by the infostealing malware from the employees’ computers.\n\nIt’s not clear exactly when the employees’ credentials were stolen or for how long they have been online.\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that several employees with access to their company’s Snowflake environments had their computers previously compromised by infostealing malware. According to a check on breach notification service Have I Been Pwned, several of the corporate email addresses used as usernames for accessing Snowflake environments were found in a recent data dump containing millions of stolen passwords scraped from various Telegram channels used for sharing stolen passwords.\n\nSnowflake spokesperson Danica Stanczak declined to answer specific questions from TechCrunch, including whether any of its customers’ data was found in the Snowflake employee’s demo account. In a statement, Snowflake said it is “suspending certain user accounts where there are strong indicators of malicious activity.”\n\nSnowflake added: “Under Snowflake’s shared responsibility model, customers are responsible for enforcing MFA with their users.” The spokesperson said Snowflake was “considering all options for MFA enablement, but we have not finalized any plans at this time.”\n\nWhen reached by email, Live Nation spokesperson Kaitlyn Henrich did not comment by press time.\n\nSantander did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMissing MFA resulted in huge breaches\n\nSnowflake’s response so far leaves a lot of questions unanswered, and lays bare a raft of companies that are not reaping the benefits that MFA security provides.\n\nWhat is clear is that Snowflake bears at least some responsibility for not requiring its users to switch on the security feature, and is now bearing the brunt of that — along with its customers.\n\nThe data breach at Ticketmaster allegedly involves upwards of 560 million customer records, according to the cybercriminals advertising the data online. (Live Nation would not comment on how many customers are affected by the breach.) If proven, Ticketmaster would be the largest U.S. data breach of the year so far, and one of the biggest in recent history.\n\nSnowflake is the latest company in a string of high-profile security incidents and sizable data breaches caused by the lack of MFA.\n\nLast year, cybercriminals scraped around 6.9 million customer records from 23andMe accounts that weren’t protected without MFA, prompting the genetic testing company — and its competitors — to require users enable MFA by default to prevent a repeat attack.\n\nAnd earlier this year, the UnitedHealth-owned health tech giant Change Healthcare admitted hackers broke into its systems and stole huge amounts of sensitive health data from a system not protected with MFA. The healthcare giant hasn’t yet said how many individuals had their information compromised but said it is likely to affect a “substantial proportion of people in America.”\n\nDo you know more about the Snowflake account intrusions?

      "title": "ClickUp wants to take on Notion and Confluence with its new AI-based Knowledge Base",
      "content": "Since its launch in 2017, ClickUp has become a popular and well-funded productivity tool. And like all productivity tools, the ClickUp team has also heard the siren song of artificial intelligence. The company has now launched what it calls “ClickUp Knowledge Management,” which combines a new wiki-like editor with a new AI system that can also bring in data from Google Drive, Dropbox, Confluence, Figma and other sources. With that, the company aims to build a tool that can rival other popular services like Notion and Atlassian’s Confluence.\n\nClickUp co-founder and CEO Zeb Evans told me that he believes AI is critical for knowledge management, but to get the most out of that, businesses need a central repository for all of that knowledge.\n\nImage Credits: ClickUp\n\n“In the majority of companies, you have your actual knowledge, that’s written in a certain place like a Confluence [wiki] or Notion,” he said. “And then you have a lot of knowledge in different places. There are some startups like Glean that are starting to connect the dots between that, but the real problem that exists now is that you can go to one tool and kind of connect the dots, but you can’t actually edit and manage those dots and do the work about the work on that same platform.”\n\nThat’s a problem the ClickUp team itself faced over the years. And while you could already author documents on the platform, the team decided to build a new product from the ground up that starts with a wiki at its core (and one that feels more like Notion than Confluence) but then also integrates with a new AI system that can pull in data from all of these other sources.\n\n“You can build wikis in ClickUp, but we also now connect to all of your other work tools and aggregate the knowledge in one central company brain, so to speak, where you can write wikis based on all of the context that’s available to you today,” Evans said.\n\nThe result, ClickUp argues, is a system that brings together the best of Notion, Confluence and Glean to allow users to quickly create documents. For texts like project reports, team updates, summaries and standups, the team created prebuilt templates. Users can also utilize the system to automatically assign tasks, populate task data and find duplicate tasks.\n\nThere is, of course, also a chatbot that people can use to query their documents. What’s nifty here, though, is that ClickUp has built the system in a way that not only cites all of its sources but also proactively asks the user if it should create relevant documents for them based on the query results.\n\nImage Credits: ClickUp\n\nEvans stressed that the system takes an employee’s existing access permissions into account, so the AI will only surface information that a given user is allowed to work with.\n\nAbout two years ago, ClickUp acquired Slapdash, a universal search tool that brought together data from what are traditionally siloed SaaS apps. Since then, ClickUp worked on rebuilding the Slapdash architecture so that it could work with AI. This now enables the ClickUp Knowledge Management to perform retrieval augmented generation (RAG) — which has quickly become the industry standard for augmenting large language models (LLMs) with additional and up-to-date information.\n\n“It’s not a surface-level integration, where with a lot of these things, they use an API to go search all the things. Instead, we are actually digesting all of your databases from your connected applications so we can do a lot of cool stuff with that,” Evans said.\n\nLooking ahead, ClickUp aims to use this new system to reduce the amount of work about work even more.\n\n“Our big thing for this next release is killing work about work. I hate work about work. I hate having to go ask a bunch of questions and figure out where things are and figure out what people are working on. Every company right now, if you calculate how much time is spent on just writing a standup every single day. ‘This is what I did today. This is what I did yesterday.’ It’s insane,” said Evans.",

      "content": "Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft is officially on its way to the International Space Station, marking an historic first for the long-delayed astronaut transportation program. Inside the spacecraft are two NASA astronauts — spaceflight veterans Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams — who are set to arrive to the station on Thursday.\n\nThe spacecraft lifted off at 10:55 a.m. ET from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center aboard an Atlas V rocket from United Launch Alliance (a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture). The liftoff comes after a string of delays that pushed the mission back by nearly a month, first due to issues with the Atlas rocket and later due to a problem with one of the three ground computers responsible for the launch countdown.\n\nWhile there are more milestones Starliner must hit before Boeing and NASA can call the mission a success — docking to the ISS and eventually returning the astronauts back to Earth — it’s still a historic leap forward for the aerospace giant’s long-delayed astronaut transportation program.\n\nIf all goes to plan, Boeing will become NASA’s second astronaut transportation provider, joining Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Both companies were awarded multi-billion-dollar NASA contracts to develop a crewed taxi service a decade ago, but Boeing’s program has been beset by technical delays that have run the company more than $1.5 billion over budget. Boeing did execute a successful uncrewed mission to the ISS in May 2022, but this is the first time the spacecraft has carried humans.\n\nWhile Boeing has struggled, SpaceX has soared: Using its Crew Dragon capsule, SpaceX has been providing astronaut transportation to and from the ISS since 2020.\n\nWilmore and Williams will make an around 26-hour journey to the ISS, with an anticipated arrival of around 12:15 p.m. EST Thursday. During their journey, they’ll perform a handful of flight test objectives to support Strainer’s certification for regular missions. They’ll need to demonstrate the performance of crew equipment from prelaunch to ascent, and assess Starliner’s thrust performance, test navigation systems, conduct communication checkouts, and evaluate life-support systems.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. Image Credits: Miguel J. Rodriguez Carrillo / AFP\n\nEven after Starliner autonomously docks to the station and the crew are onboard the ISS, the two astronauts will evaluate even more of the spacecraft’s performance, including determining whether it can act as a “safe haven” for astronauts in the unlikely event of an issue aboard the space station.\n\nWilmore and Williams will remain onboard the station for around a week before reboarding the spacecraft. After just six hours, Starliner is expected to make a landing under parachutes and assisted by airbags somewhere in the southwestern United States.\n\nThis is the last major step before Starliner can be certified as an operational crew system, and the first Starliner mission is expected to launch in 2025.",

      "title": "SiTration uses silicon wafers to reclaim critical minerals from mining waste",
      "content": "Brendan Smith didn’t intend to be in the critical minerals business. He initially thought his high-tech filters would be good at desalination. But it was hard to beat existing systems, so he and his adviser, MIT professor Jeffrey Grossman, quickly ruled it out. After a few years “where we sort of intentionally meandered,” they found themselves in a very different industry: mining.\n\nProducing critical minerals is not a pretty business. Take copper, for example: The world uses around 25 million tons of copper per year, and more buildings, electronics, and electric vehicles mean that demand is expected to grow 24% over the next decade. Each ton of copper ore recovered leaves behind around 100–150 tons of waste.\n\nThat’s a lot of waste, so much so that some mines have run out of room for tailings ponds, which hold the toxic chemicals and byproducts that remain after valuable minerals are removed.\n\n“If you don’t have the land to build more of these ponds, you don’t have a lot of options,” Smith told TechCrunch. What’s more, because these ponds are open to the elements, rain and snow turn what could be a tractable problem into a never-ending one.\n\nFor many mine operators, dealing with waste is a costly part of the business. But Smith and Grossman’s company, SiTration, has a different proposal: use its equipment to treat the wastewater and harvest more minerals in the process.\n\n“If you can do it for low cost, efficiently — which we can do — you can recoup some of the costs of remediation or even profit a little bit from that operation,” he said.\n\nThe key, Smith said, is silicon. SiTration’s filters are built on the same style of wafers that are used to make computer chips and solar panels, though using a cheaper grade of silicon. To turn the wafers into filters, Smith and Grossman tweaked an existing chemical treatment to etch minute pores in them. The resulting material is more durable than existing membranes and, depending on what it’s filtering, should last at least three years, Smith said.\n\nIn a finished system, the company stacks a series of wafers atop one another and allows the liquids to flow through. For a larger mining site, the company would use about as much silicon as a medium-size solar farm, Smith said.\n\nBecause silicon is a semiconductor, SiTration can send an electric current through the filters to make them even more effective for a range of minerals, including platinum, lithium, cobalt, and nickel.\n\nAlthough SiTration is starting with mining waste, including a pilot project with Rio Tinto, it’s also pitching its filtration systems to battery recyclers and metal refiners. In the case of metal refining, Smith said that his company’s filters eliminate the need for heat while also reducing chemical use by up to 95%.\n\nSiTration’s basic technology remains the same for each industry it sells to, Smith said. “We can ship out the same box to multiple partners and customers.”\n\nTo help build more boxes, the company has raised an $11.8 million seed round led by 2150 with participation from Azolla Ventures, BHP Ventures, E14 Fund, Extantia, and Orion Industrial Ventures.\n\nIn the coming years, the company plans to deploy its filtration systems with partners in various industries. Depending on the size of the business using them, Smith said, “that could either constitute a very early demonstration for a very large volume mining partner or a pretty-close-to-commercial demonstration for a platinum group metal refiner.”",

      "content": "French AI startup Mistral is introducing new AI model customization options, including paid plans, to let developers and enterprises fine-tune its generative models for particular use cases.\n\nThe first is self-service. Mistral has released a software development kit (SDK), Mistral-Finetune, for fine-tuning its models on workstations, servers and small datacenter nodes.\n\nIn the readme for the SDK’s GitHub repository, Mistral notes that the SDK is optimized for multi-GPU setups but can scale down to a single Nvidia A100 or H100 GPU for fine-tuning smaller models like Mistral 7B. Fine-tuning on a data set such as UltraChat, a collection of 1.4 million dialogs with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, takes around half an hour using Mistral-Finetune across eight H100s, Mistral says.\n\nFor developers and companies that prefer a more managed solution, there’s Mistral’s newly launched fine-tuning services available through the company’s API. Compatible with two of Mistral’s models for now, Mistral Small and the aforementioned Mistral 7B, Mistral says that the fine-tuning services will gain support for more of its models in the coming weeks.\n\nLastly, Mistral is debuting custom training services, currently only available to select customers, to fine-tune any Mistral model for an organization’s apps using their data. “This approach enables the creation of highly specialized and optimized models for their specific domain,” the company explains in a post on its official blog.\n\nMistral, which my colleague Ingrid Lunden recently reported is seeking to raise around $600 million at a $6 billion valuation from investors including DST, General Catalyst and Lightspeed Venture Partners, is no doubt looking to grow revenue as it faces considerable — and growing — competition in the generative AI space.\n\nSince Mistral unveiled its first generative model in September 2023, it’s released several more, including a code-generating model, and rolled out paid APIs. But it hasn’t disclosed how many users it has, nor what its revenues are looking like.",

      "content": "The number of satellites on low Earth orbit is poised to explode over the coming years as more mega-constellations come online. This will create new opportunities for bad actors to hide weapons or spy satellites among their fleet.\n\nThat’s according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which tasked space startup Slingshot Aerospace with developing a new tool that could pick out potentially nefarious satellites purposefully hiding in mega-constellations. That system is called Agatha — named after one of the precogs in the film “Minority Report” — and it could provide a huge boon for national space security.\n\nDARPA officially selected Slingshot for the program — called Predictive Reporting and Enhanced Constellation Objective Guide (that’s right, PRECOG) — last March, and the work formally concluded this January. The company was awarded around $1 million for the work, according to government contracting database HigherGov.\n\nSlingshot researchers generated 60 years’ worth of synthetic constellation data with which to train Agatha, so that the system could detect minute differences in satellite behavior, using those differences to deduce the satellite’s true operational directives.\n\nAs it turns out, there are “lots of little tells that add up to something much bigger,” Slingshot’s director of data science, Dylan Kesler, said in a recent interview. That could be small changes in the mass of the satellite, which affects its station keeping, or if the satellite communicated differently with Earth, or if it was always oriented in the same direction (versus all the other satellites in the constellation).\n\nWhile Agatha was trained on simulations, Slingshot eventually tested it against real-world constellations by identifying non-nefarious outlier satellites in operators’ existing fleets. The program, which is running on Slingshot’s space domain awareness platform today, now culls data from the company’s own Global Sensor Network and its Seradata database, as well as other public and proprietary sources.\n\nOther startups have generated buzz for their plans to develop rendezvous tech to gather intelligence on adversary satellites. Slingshot’s Agatha solves the crucial question of how these operators will identify those satellites in the first place. This question becomes all the more imperative as countries like China announce plans to launch multiple mega-constellations over the coming decade.\n\n“Historically, when there weren’t these 10,000 or 15,000 mega-constellations, it’s reasonable that a human or a team of humans could look at orbital trajectory data and other sources of data and make an informed assessment of which satellites to go after,” Slingshot’s VP of strategy and policy, Audrey Schaffer, said. “But as the growth and activity in space just increases exponentially, it’s going to become impossible for a human to really sift through all of this data without the help of tools like Agatha.”",

      "content": "Wix, the platform known chiefly for its web design tools, is launching a generative AI feature that’ll let customers create and edit iOS or Android apps by describing what they want to see in plain English.\n\nThe capability, which is set to arrive in Wix’s app builder tool this week, guides users through a chatbot-like interface to understand the goals, intent and aesthetic of their app. With this info, Wix’s AI generates an app that can be customized from the app editor, and then optionally embellished with first- and third-party integrations, widgets and connectors.\n\nGenerative AI-powered app creation follows on the heels of Wix’s AI website generator, announced last July, which can output a site template complete with text and images from a series of descriptive captions. Wix co-founder and CEO Avishai Abrahami says that the new AI products are a part of Wix’s broader strategy to create “custom AI solutions” to help companies quickly spin up digital experiences.\n\n“Wix’s mission has always been to empower anyone to create an online presence, including mobile apps,” Abrahami told TechCrunch. “As a company, we have learned so much about AI and how users interact with it when creating their online presence.”\n\nApps from scratch\n\nWix says that its new AI-powered app builder, which requires a $99-per-month subscription to Wix’s premium Branded App plan, generates app code that’s “fully native” to iOS and Android. Users have control over their app’s branding, layout and features, including icons and themes, and can preview the app before submitting it to the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.\n\n“The goal of our AI is to offload most, if not all, of the hard work from the user,” Abrahami said. “The more detailed the answers to the prompts during setup, the more personalized and complete the AI-generated app will be.”\n\nImage Credits: Wix\n\nThat sounds great in theory. But reviews of Wix’s AI site builder aren’t exactly glowing, with early adopters reporting bugs and generic-looking finished products.\n\nSo given that the under-the-hood tech is similar, outside a few upgraded generative AI models, why should people expect Wix’s AI app builder to be any better?\n\nAbrahami brushed aside the complaints about Wix’s site builder, claiming that feedback has been “overwhelmingly positive” and that customers have created hundreds of thousands of AI-generated websites since its launch.\n\nImage Credits: Wix\n\n“This strong response and utilization underscore the depth of our AI expertise and the strength of our product team,” he said. “We’re excited to extend this experience to mobile as well.”\n\nThe stakes are a bit higher with apps, though — at least from a security standpoint.\n\nGenerative AI tools are resulting in more mistaken code being pushed to codebases and amplifying existing bugs and security issues in app code, studies and surveys show. In fact, over half of the answers OpenAI’s ChatGPT gives to programming questions are wrong, according to research from Purdue.\n\nImage Credits: Wix\n\nAbrahami admitted that the AI app builder, like all generative AI tools, might make mistakes. But he said that Wix is committed to “[improving] the product all the time.”\n\n“Our security team implements and maintains robust security measures for all our solutions, including the mobile app builder,” he added. “The applications and code are subject to constant security and penetration reviews and monitoring.”\n\nCan it replace developers?\n\nAssuming Wix’s AI-powered app designer works as advertised, it might threaten firms — and solopreneurs — in the multi-billion-dollar business of building smartphone apps for brands.\n\nThere’s FlutterFlow, Crowdaa and the Mobile-First Company, to name a few — many of which also employ AI in various forms. On Fiverr, a cursory search yields a long list of highly rated app developers, some of whom charge around the same price as a subscription to Wix’s AI app builder.\n\nAbrahami asserts that Wix isn’t trying to replace developers, but rather provide an alternative for customers who want it. The tool, he says, deeply integrates with Wix’s wider product portfolio — potentially making it more appealing to Wix’s millions of existing users — and brings features like usage analytics and app update handling through the relevant app stores.\n\n“Professional developers continue to play a crucial role, particularly for more complex and specialized app projects,” Abrahami said. “There is room for both routes to app creation.”\n\nI’m not so sure app developers will agree — but they don’t exactly have much choice in the matter.",

      "content": "Stability AI, the startup behind the AI-powered art generator Stable Diffusion, has released an open AI model for generating sounds and songs that it claims was trained exclusively on royalty-free recordings.\n\nCalled Stable Audio Open, the generative model takes a text description (e.g. “Rock beat played in a treated studio, session drumming on an acoustic kit”) and outputs a recording up to 47 seconds in length. The model was trained using around 486,000 samples from free music libraries FreeSound and the Free Music Archive.\n\nStability AI says that the model can be used to create drum beats, instrument riffs, ambient noises and “production elements” for videos, films and TV shows as well as to “edit” existing songs or apply the style of one song (e.g. smooth jazz) to another.\n\n“A key benefit of this open source release is that users can fine-tune the model on their own custom audio data,” Stability AI wrote in a post on its corporate blog. “For example, a drummer could fine-tune on samples of their own drum recordings to generate new beats.”\n\nStable Audio Open has its limitations, however. It can’t produce full songs, melodies or vocals — at least not good ones. Stability AI says that it’s not optimized for this, and suggests that users looking for those capabilities opt for the company’s premium Stable Audio service.\n\nStable Audio Open also can’t be used commercially; its terms of service prohibit it. And it doesn’t perform equally well across musical styles and cultures or with descriptions in languages other than English — biases Stability AI blames on the training data.\n\n“The source of data is potentially lacking diversity and all cultures are not equally represented in the data set,” Stability AI writes in a description of the model. “The generated samples from the model will reflect the biases from the training data.”\n\nStability AI — which has long struggled to turn its flagging business around — became the subject of controversy recently after its VP of generative audio, Ed Newton-Rex, resigned over disagreement with the company’s stance that training generative AI models on copyrighted works constitutes “fair use.” Stable Audio Open would appear to be an attempt to turn that narrative around, while at the same time not-so-subtly advertising Stability AI’s paid products.\n\nAs music generators including Stability’s gain in popularity, copyright — and the ways in which some creators of generators might be abusing it — is becoming a central point of focus.\n\nIn May, Sony Music, which represents artists, including Billy Joel, Doja Cat and Lil Nas X, sent a letter to 700 AI companies warning against “unauthorized use” of its content for training audio generators. And in March, the U.S.’ first law aimed at tamping down abuses of AI in music was signed into law in Tennessee.",

      "title": "This Week in AI: Ex-OpenAI staff call for safety and transparency",
      "content": "Hiya, folks, and welcome to TechCrunch’s inaugural AI newsletter. It’s truly a thrill to type those words — this one’s been long in the making, and we’re excited to finally share it with you.\n\nWith the launch of TC’s AI newsletter, we’re sunsetting This Week in AI, the semiregular column previously known as Perceptron. But you’ll find all the analysis we brought to This Week in AI and more, including a spotlight on noteworthy new AI models, right here.\n\nThis week in AI, trouble’s brewing — again — for OpenAI.\n\nA group of former OpenAI employees spoke with The New York Times’ Kevin Roose about what they perceive as egregious safety failings within the organization. They — like others who’ve left OpenAI in recent months — claim that the company isn’t doing enough to prevent its AI systems from becoming potentially dangerous and accuse OpenAI of employing hardball tactics to attempt to prevent workers from sounding the alarm.\n\nThe group published an open letter on Tuesday calling for leading AI companies, including OpenAI, to establish greater transparency and more protections for whistleblowers. “So long as there is no effective government oversight of these corporations, current and former employees are among the few people who can hold them accountable to the public,” the letter reads.\n\nCall me pessimistic, but I expect the ex-staffers’ calls will fall on deaf ears. It’s tough to imagine a scenario in which AI companies not only agree to “support a culture of open criticism,” as the undersigned recommend, but also opt not to enforce nondisparagement clauses or retaliate against current staff who choose to speak out.\n\nConsider that OpenAI’s safety commission, which the company recently created in response to initial criticism of its safety practices, is staffed with all company insiders — including CEO Sam Altman. And consider that Altman, who at one point claimed to have no knowledge of OpenAI’s restrictive nondisparagement agreements, himself signed the incorporation documents establishing them.\n\nSure, things at OpenAI could turn around tomorrow — but I’m not holding my breath. And even if they did, it’d be tough to trust it.\n\nNews\n\nAI apocalypse: OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot platform, ChatGPT — along with Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini and Perplexity — all went down this morning at roughly the same time. All the services have since been restored, but the cause of their downtime remains unclear.\n\nOpenAI exploring fusion: OpenAI is in talks with fusion startup Helion Energy about a deal in which the AI company would buy vast quantities of electricity from Helion to provide power for its data centers, according to the Wall Street Journal. Altman has a $375 million stake in Helion and sits on the company’s board of directors, but he reportedly has recused himself from the deal talks.\n\nThe cost of training data: TechCrunch takes a look at the pricey data licensing deals that are becoming commonplace in the AI industry — deals that threaten to make AI research untenable for smaller organizations and academic institutions.\n\nHateful music generators: Malicious actors are abusing AI-powered music generators to create homophobic, racist and propagandistic songs — and publishing guides instructing others how to do so as well.\n\nCash for Cohere: Reuters reports that Cohere, an enterprise-focused generative AI startup, has raised $450 million from Nvidia, Salesforce Ventures, Cisco and others in a new tranche that values Cohere at $5 billion. Sources familiar tell TechCrunch that Oracle and Thomvest Ventures — both returning investors — also participated in the round, which was left open.\n\nResearch paper of the week\n\nIn a research paper from 2023 titled “Let’s Verify Step by Step” that OpenAI recently highlighted on its official blog, scientists at OpenAI claimed to have fine-tuned the startup’s general-purpose generative AI model, GPT-4, to achieve better-than-expected performance in solving math problems. The approach could lead to generative models less prone to going off the rails, the co-authors of the paper say — but they point out several caveats.\n\nIn the paper, the co-authors detail how they trained reward models to detect hallucinations, or instances where GPT-4 got its facts and/or answers to math problems wrong. (Reward models are specialized models to evaluate the outputs of AI models, in this case math-related outputs from GPT-4.) The reward models “rewarded” GPT-4 each time it got a step of a math problem right, an approach the researchers refer to as “process supervision.”\n\nThe researchers say that process supervision improved GPT-4’s math problem accuracy compared to previous techniques of “rewarding” models — at least in their benchmark tests. They admit it’s not perfect, however; GPT-4 still got problem steps wrong. And it’s unclear how the form of process supervision the researchers explored might generalize beyond the math domain.\n\nModel of the week\n\nForecasting the weather may not feel like a science (at least when you get rained on, like I just did), but that’s because it’s all about probabilities, not certainties. And what better way to calculate probabilities than a probabilistic model? We’ve already seen AI put to work on weather prediction at time scales from hours to centuries, and now Microsoft is getting in on the fun. The company’s new Aurora model moves the ball forward in this fast-evolving corner of the AI world, providing globe-level predictions at ~0.1° resolution (think on the order of 10 km square).\n\nImage Credits: Microsoft\n\nTrained on over a million hours of weather and climate simulations (not real weather? Hmm…) and fine-tuned on a number of desirable tasks, Aurora outperforms traditional numerical prediction systems by several orders of magnitude. More impressively, it beats Google DeepMind’s GraphCast at its own game (though Microsoft picked the field), providing more accurate guesses of weather conditions on the one- to five-day scale.\n\nCompanies like Google and Microsoft have a horse in the race, of course, both vying for your online attention by trying to offer the most personalized web and search experience. Accurate, efficient first-party weather forecasts are going to be an important part of that, at least until we stop going outside.\n\nGrab bag\n\nIn a thought piece last month in Palladium, Avital Balwit, chief of staff at AI startup Anthropic, posits that the next three years might be the last she and many knowledge workers have to work thanks to generative AI’s rapid advancements. This should come as a comfort rather than a reason to fear, she says, because it could “[lead to] a world where people have their material needs met but also have no need to work.”\n\n“A renowned AI researcher once told me that he is practicing for [this inflection point] by taking up activities that he is not particularly good at: jiu-jitsu, surfing, and so on, and savoring the doing even without excellence,” Balwit writes. “This is how we can prepare for our future where we will have to do things from joy rather than need, where we will no longer be the best at them, but will still have to choose how to fill our days.”\n\nThat’s certainly the glass-half-full view — but one I can’t say I share.\n\nShould generative AI replace most knowledge workers within three years (which seems unrealistic to me given AI’s many unsolved technical problems), economic collapse could well ensue. Knowledge workers make up large portions of the workforce and tend to be high earners — and thus big spenders. They drive the wheels of capitalism forward.\n\nBalwit makes references to universal basic income and other large-scale social safety net programs. But I don’t have a lot of faith that countries like the U.S., which can’t even manage basic federal-level AI legislation, will adopt universal basic income schemes anytime soon.\n\nWith any luck, I’m wrong.",

      "content": "Data transformation startup Tobiko may not be a household name yet, but you may have seen co-founder and CEO Tyson Mao on “Beauty and the Geek” back in the aughts and his co-founder, brother and CTO Toby Mao, on the speedcubing circuit. (Both have held world records in the past, and Tyson co-founded the World Cube Association.)\n\nSince then, the brothers, together with their co-founder Iaroslav Zeigerman, have worked at a wide variety of companies, ranging from Apple to Airbnb, Google and Netflix, where Tyson and Zeigerman first met.\n\nNow with Tobiko, they aim to reimagine how teams work with data by offering a dbt-compatible data transformation platform, with the popular SQLMesh and SQLGlot open source projects at its core and an intuitive low-code user interface to build data pipelines and transformations.\n\nThe company on Tuesday is launching its cloud platform and announcing a total of $21.8 million in funding, split between a $4.5 million seed round and a $17.3 million Series A round. Among the investors involved are Theory Ventures, 20Sales, Fivetran CEO George Fraser, Census CEO Boris Jabes, and MotherDuck CEO Jordan Tigani.\n\nWhile at Airbnb, Toby led the Minerva project, the company’s internal metrics semantic layer. He says it was then that he realized that the real power of Minerva wasn’t the semantics but its data transformation capabilities.\n\n“The steps from getting from raw data to actual business value — there’s a lot of stuff going on there,” he told me. “It’s a lot of hard work. And so we wanted to eventually build a semantics company, but first we want to solve transformation. And so at Airbnb, I got a demo of the industry standard tools, dbt, and that gave me the inspiration to start this.”\n\nImage Credits: Tobiko\n\nToby acknowledged the popularity and functionality of dbt, which has become somewhat of an industry standard for building. But he argued that it’s not the right solution for every company. “DBT was really designed to accelerate Series A companies’ data stacks,” he said. “We wanted to make a data platform, a data transformation tool, that could work at any company, even FAANG-style. So we took our experience, our collective knowledge, and built a system that would scale with both large amounts of data and large amounts of people.”\n\nAs Zeigerman explained, at the core of this modern platform is SQLMesh, an open source tool that allows developers to build data pipelines with built-in tools for data transformation, testing and collaboration. This is also where the team’s background in semantics comes in. “SQLMesh understands SQL, as opposed to treating it as a piece of text,” he explained. And that understanding comes from SQLGlot, which Toby created during his time at Airbnb. “This ability to understand SQL unlocks a bunch of things that significantly boost the speed of developing and engineering productivity.”\n\nImage Credits: Tobiko\n\nThis tool enabled Tobiko to do syntax checking on SQL queries, for example, before they are sent to the database. It also categorizes and tracks all of the changes that engineers make in the development process and tells them whether their break anything in relation to other datasets and transformations in the system.\n\n“We truly believe that this is going to be one of the first observability tools that not only understands that something broke, but why it broke, because we understand your code, we understand every version of every code you’ve ever written, and we can tie every failure to that change,” Tyson said.\n\nImage Credits: Tobiko\n\nTobiko also offers businesses the ability to create what the team calls “virtual data environments” that developers can use during the development phase and then reuse for other projects (or even in production).\n\nThe team tells me that it is mostly targeting data engineering teams right now and that it is working with customers of all sizes, including some unicorn startups. A lot of them are bringing entirely new applications to the service, but since it is compatible with dbt, there are also a number of dbt users who have made the switch.",

      "title": "Bluesky and Mastodon users can now talk to each other with Bridgy Fed",
      "content": "An important step toward a more interoperable “fediverse” — the broader network of decentralized social media apps like Mastodon, Bluesky and others — has been achieved. Now, users on decentralized apps like Mastodon, powered by the ActivityPub protocol, and those powered by Bluesky’s AT Protocol, can easily follow people on other networks, see their posts, as well as like, reply and repost them.\n\nThose same people will be able to see the others’ posts in return, too.\n\nThe technology making this possible is Bridgy Fed, one of the efforts aimed at connecting the fediverse with the web, Bluesky and, perhaps later, other networks like Nostr.\n\nSince the 2022 sale of Twitter to Elon Musk, who rebranded the app X, there’s been a surge of interest in decentralized social media. Apps like Mastodon gained a following in the wake of Twitter’s new ownership, as users explored what a network without a centralized authority may look like. Meanwhile, Bluesky — a startup originally incubated within Twitter — raised a seed round and grew its network to over 5.7 million users after launching publicly earlier this year.\n\nOther decentralized social media networks are finding footing of their own, too, like the blockchain-based Farcaster, which just last month closed on $150 million in funding from Paradigm, a16z crypto, Haun Ventures, USV and others.\n\nThere’s just one problem these networks face in gaining traction against a rival like X or Meta’s Threads: Their users couldn’t talk to each other.\n\nThough both Mastodon and Bluesky are decentralized social media efforts, they rely on different underlying protocols. That means a Mastodon user can interact with others who post elsewhere on the fediverse — that is, other apps that use the older ActivityPub social networking protocol. But they couldn’t interact with people who posted on Bluesky, because it uses the newer AT Protocol to operate.\n\nSoftware developer Ryan Barrett has been working to address this problem with Bridgy Fed, a social networking bridge that would connect fediverse users to those on Bluesky and vice versa.\n\nThough the matter was originally fraught with debate over the bridge’s planned opt-out nature, Barrett listened to the community feedback and made the bridge opt-in on both sides for the time being.\n\nThat could shift in the future, however, to becoming opt-out for Bluesky users only. “The norms and expectations there are somewhat different than in the fediverse,” he told TechCrunch.\n\nBridgy Fed itself soft-launched in mid-April and transitioned to a full launch over the past month. It’s now one of many different efforts to bridge networks in the fediverse, in addition to Sasquatch, pinhole, RSS Parrot, mostr.pub and SkyBridge, though many are not as fully bidirectional as Bridgy is.\n\nHow to use Bridgy Fed\n\nUsing Bridgy Fed is fairly easy. It only works with public accounts and public posts, for starters, so there’s no concern about your private or followers-only posts being replicated elsewhere.\n\nTo bridge an account from the fediverse to Bluesky, you simply follow the Mastodon account @bsky.brid.gy@bsky.brid.gy. The account will follow you back. You’ll then automatically have a new, bridged account available to Bluesky users under your fediverse/Mastodon handle (where the second @ is now a dot) followed by “ap.brid.gy.”\n\nFor example, if my Mastodon account is @sarahp@mastodon.social then my bridged account is @sarahp.mastodon.social.ap.brid.gy.\n\n(OK, sure it’s a lot of letters, but it works!)\n\nImage Credits: Bluesky screenshot of bridged account\n\nOn the flip side, if you want to bridge your Bluesky account to the fediverse, then you’ll follow the @ap.brid.gy account on Bluesky. Similarly, you’ll then be provided with a bridged version of your Bluesky account in the fediverse. In this case, the format is @[handle]@bsky.brid.gy.\n\nSo if my Bluesky account is @sarahp@bsky.social, then my bridged account is @sarahp.bsky.social@bsky.brid.gy. It will also be labeled as an “automated” account on Mastodon, as well, so people know it’s a bridged account.\n\nAnything from your Bluesky account that interacts with fediverse users will be bridged, including replies, @-mentions, likes, reports, and, if you have fediverse followers, your own Bluesky posts. The same is true for the reverse.\n\nThis is different from cross-posting, to be clear, where you post once using software that then publishes it to all your connected accounts. Instead, it’s more like setting up a mirror of your feed on another platform. This could help you reach more people as you’ll be able to engage with people on a different social network.\n\nThe fediverse-to-Bluesky bridge (and vice versa) are both still in early beta testing, so you will likely come across issues, bugs, downtime and other problems for now.\n\nBarrett says he has more plans ahead for Bridgy Fed, too, including the launch of a prompt to make it discoverable. “When you try to follow someone who isn’t yet bridged, it will send them a DM to ask them to opt in. I’m waiting on Bluesky’s upcoming OAuth support for that,” he notes.\n\nThe bridge currently works with fediverse servers like Mastodon, Friendica, Misskey, PeerTube, Hubzilla and others, as well as Bluesky and your own website. Later, it plans to incorporate Nostr support into its bridge as well — a decentralized social service now favored by Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey.",

      "content": "Enterprise software giant SAP on Wednesday said it is acquiring “digital adoption” platform provider WalkMe for $1.5 billion in cash.\n\nSAP’s $14-per-share offer represents a premium of about 45% on WalkMe’s closing price of $9.64 on Tuesday.\n\nFounded out of Israel in 2011, WalkMe was initially designed to simplify website navigation by providing real-time, on-screen guidance. Over the years, the company moved its headquarters to San Francisco and bolstered its platform with more features, focusing more on both consumer and enterprise applications — for instance, to guide users through new features or to onboard new employees.\n\nThis took the form of little balloon overlays or even on-screen prompts to try and convert free users into paying customers. The company essentially sought to automate a process that would otherwise be a resource-intensive endeavor with human help alone.\n\nAs part of its enterprise push, WalkMe also provides insights into end-user behavior, focusing on providing extra support tools or information at points where a user is more likely to exit an application.\n\nIt is this focus on automating contextual, in-app support that SAP sees as bringing value to its own enterprise customers.\n\nAutomation for the enterprise\n\nWalkMe had raised around $300 million before its 2021 IPO, but like many companies during the pandemic period, its valuation plummeted in the intervening years, going from a peak of $2.8 billion in September 2021 to a little more than $600 million within a year — substantially below its last-known private valuation of around $2 billion. The company’s market capitalization has hovered around $800 million to $900 million this year, but off the back of strong earnings last month, its shares rose 25% in two weeks.\n\nIndeed, in May, WalkMe reported that its first-quarter revenue rose 4% from a year earlier and unveiled WalkMeX, a new AI-powered copilot that suggests “the best next step for any workflow, anywhere” using its existing contextual awareness smarts. SAP said it intends to integrate WalkMeX with its own Joule copilot, which it debuted last September.\n\nSAP, for its part, has been on a tear of late, with its strong financial performance pushing its valuation to an all-time high of $230 billion this year.\n\nNotably, the WalkMe deal is designed to complement two other acquisitions SAP has made in the past few years. It acquired fellow German firm Signavio, a business process automation company, for $1.2 billion in 2021. And late last year, it bought another German company called LeanIX, which specializes in enterprise architecture management — basically helping companies modernize more quickly.\n\nWalkMe fits into that pattern, insofar as it’s all about helping companies transform for the modern software era, where people, AI and the cloud intersect.\n\n“Applications, processes, data, and people are the four key elements of a successful business transformation,” SAP CEO Christian Klein said in a press release. “By acquiring WalkMe, we are doubling down on the support we provide our end users, helping them to quickly adopt new solutions and features to get the maximum value out of their IT investments.”\n\nSAP said it expects the acquisition to close, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, in Q3 2024.",

The company Wednesday issued an email requesting customers discontinue use of its egg-shaped charging case.\n\nThe warning was issued “out of an abundance of caution,” according to Humane. The company says it launched an investigation following a “single complaint” of a charging issue from a customer. Ultimately Humane determined the supplied batteries to be a potential fire hazard.\n\n“Our investigation determined that the battery supplier was no longer meeting our quality standards and that there is a potential that certain battery cells supplied by this vendor may pose a fire safety risk,” Humane wrote in an email viewed by TechCrunch. “As a result, we immediately disqualified this battery vendor while we work to identify a new vendor to avoid such issues and maintain our high quality standards.”\n\nWe reached out to company for more detail and asked whether Humane has any intention of issuing a full recall or refunds. Currently, the company is offering consolation in the form of two free months of its $24 subscription service.\n\nHumane is far from the first consumer electronics company to ship products with potentially hazardous batteries. The timing of the news is less than ideal, however, as its founders have reportedly been shopping the company around to potential buyers a mere months after launching its first product.\n\nAccording to the note, the Charge Case is the only Humane product affected by this news.

      "content": "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are complex, computationally expensive and not typically something that startups focus on. But that’s exactly what Boston- and Berlin-based Dive is doing. The company aims to change how manufacturers use computer simulations by using both modern mathematical approaches and cloud computing to disrupt a market that is mostly dominated by a small number of incumbents.\n\nDive’s customer list includes the likes of BMW, BSH, Kärcher, Siemens and ZF.\n\nImage Credits: Dive\n\nThe company, which on Wednesday announced that it has raised a $10 million Series A round led by D.E. Shaw Group, was spun out of German multinational Bosch in 2018. Dive co-founder and CEO Pierre Sabrowski tells me that he started working at Bosch after his PhD studies. His first few years were spent trying to simulate washing machines.\n\n“The washing machine seems like such a small thing, but there are, I think, 700 or 800 engineers these days — maybe even more — in Berlin, dedicatedly working on the washing machines of Bosch. So this is huge. It’s a huge market, and we were part of simulating that. And we simply failed,” he told me.\n\nThe techniques available at the time simply weren’t good enough to simulate something as complex as fluids moving in a washing machine. But after a few years of trying, the team happened upon a technique used by astrophysicists that treats fluids as being made up of particles instead of as an interconnected mesh, like older techniques did.\n\nImage Credits: Dive\n\nThe team at Bosch started extending an open source tool to perform those mesh-free simulations for its own needs, all while working on the fundamental science behind it, too. “The team around that group is pretty big and in 2017, our department lead said: ‘Hey, OK, the team is too big. We can’t afford that anymore in Bosch alone. The number of applications is also limited to what we can do at Bosch, so maybe you guys should start as a spin-off.’”\n\nAt first, the team was mostly doing projects for clients because, as Sabrowski told me, the software itself wasn’t at a point where anybody outside of Dive could really use it yet. By 2021, though, Dive started selling licenses and then raised its seed round, even before it had a real 3D interface to visualize the results.\n\nImage Credits: Dive\n\nSome of Dive’s earliest customers came from the automotive industry, which is maybe no surprise, given its experiences with simulating liquids in closed, rotating environments. In that respect, washing machines and gear boxes aren’t all that different. The company also still targets household appliance manufacturers, as well as companies building dispensing systems.\n\nOffering a better simulation is definitely an incentive for Dive’s customers, but Sabrowski also stressed that the team spent a lot of time on how it wants to deliver its solution. In the end, Dive decided to go with a cloud-enabled solution, where the interface lives on the desktop\n\nDive’s Series A round was led by D.E. Shaw, with First Momentum Ventures, Segenia Capital and Senovo Capital participating in Dive’s seed round. The company plans to use the new funding to expand its simulation portfolio to cover a wider range of use cases and strengthen its data analytics and data governance programs. Dive’s customers are already storing their engineering data in Dive’s cloud platform, after all, so helping them best analyze and leverage that data is an obvious next step.\n\n“We’re excited about Dive’s potential to transform the manufacturing and computer-aided engineering industries,” said Jean Nations of the D. E. Shaw Group. “Dive’s mesh-free and cloud-native approach is designed to enable engineers to create simulations that reduce industrial production timelines and costs, leading to greater efficiency in the engineering process.”",

There’s a stream on YouTube as well, but that has a tendency to lag a bit.\n\nOver the past couple of years, critics have noted that the company has thus far been falling behind the likes of Google, Microsoft and OpenAI when it comes to generative AI research.

Hoop, a productivity startup founded by a group of early Trello employees, wants to use AI to help you automatically generate and track your to-do list.\n\nThe company today announced a $5 million seed funding round led by Index Ventures, with participation from Origin Ventures, Divergent Capital, and Chingona Ventures.\n\nImage Credits: Hoop\n\nThe core idea behind Hoop is that it will use AI to automatically capture potential tasks from Google Meet and Zoom meetings and Slack messages (with other platforms coming later, starting with email) and pull those into the Hoop to-do list.\n\nThe company was founded by Stella Garber, Brian Schmidt, and Justin Gallagher. Garber, who is Hoop’s CEO, led marketing at Trello, while Gallagher was the first product person at Trello and built the company’s mobile app, and Schmidt led operations, finance and legal.\n\n“We were thinking about the next step in our careers and we just really wanted to recapture the magic of the early days of Trello and do it again,” Garber said. As the team looked at how the landscape had changed, they realized that now more than ever, people are being bombarded with meetings and messages and needed a way to track everything they had to do, but then ended up spending too much time managing their productivity tools.\n\n“If you started with AI as the starting point for task management, what could you do differently? I think that was a real lightbulb moment for us, because we realize that so many of the existing platforms have to layer in and add AI on top to make their existing things work,” Garber said. And indeed, an AI bot that joins meetings, transcribes them and takes notes isn’t exactly new at this point, but the Hoop team argues that none of these existing platforms focus on productivity and to-do lists — and none of the teams working on them have the pedigree of the Hoop founders given their experience at Trello.\n\nCurrently, Hoop is a bit of a single-player experience, but Garber tells me that the company plans to add more team features in the future. “We are really, really focused on making [Hoop] as useful for the individual as possible before we expand to teams, but it’s a very natural thing for us to do,” Garber said. And while Hoop right now mostly looks like a standard to-do list, the company plans to add different views over time as well.\n\nIn addition to the institutional investors who participated in this round, Hoop also brought on a mix of angel investors, including Wade Foster, the CEO of Zapier; Job van der Voort, the CEO of Remote; Andy Dunn, the former CEO of Bonobos; Annie Duke, the first woman to win the World Series of Poker; Maria Katris, the CEO and co-founder of Built In; Maggie Adhami-Boynton, the CEO and co-founder of ShopThing; and Sean Harper, CEO and co-founder of Kin.",

      "content": "In 1816, French physician René Laennec invented an instrument that allowed doctors to listen to the heart and lungs. That device — a stethoscope — eventually evolved from a simple wooden tube to a lightweight two-earpiece version most doctors today wear around their necks.\n\nEko Health, a startup founded in 2013, is bringing this ubiquitous medical tool into the digital age by enhancing it with AI. Over the past decade, Eko has sold its stethoscope to more than 500,000 physicians and healthcare providers. Because they’ve been used on millions of patients, the company has amassed a large dataset of chest sounds and electrocardiogram (ECG) information, which Eko used to develop various algorithms for detecting heart conditions.\n\n“The stethoscope exam is incredibly inconsistent and inaccurate. Patients get late diagnoses, or they get misdiagnosed,” said Connor Landgraf, Eko Health’s CEO and founder. “We want to bring precision using AI that could enable patients to get earlier, more competent diagnoses.”\n\nLandgraf explained that with a traditional stethoscope, a physician can’t always hear the subtle differences between health and disease. “With our AI, they can combine [heart sounds] with cardiac rhythm assessment and then have the AI interpret that. You almost have the skills of a cardiologist in the pocket of a primary care physician or even a nurse practitioner or a frontline healthcare professional,” he said.\n\nIn April, the Eko stethoscope received FDA clearance for using its AI to help detect the first signs of heart failure during a routine medical exam. That’s the company’s third algorithm to receive FDA approval. Eko’s AI has also recently been cleared to detect heart murmurs, which could be a sign of abnormal heart valves. (A Massachusetts General Hospital study found that Eko’s AI identified more than two times as many patients with heart disease compared to primary care doctors.)\n\nEko’s clinical milestones have helped it raise a $41 million Series D round with participation by Artis Ventures, Highland Capital Partners, NTTVC and Questa Capital. The latest capital infusion brings the company’s total funding to $165 million.\n\nThe fresh financing will go toward training AI algorithms to detect pulmonary conditions such as asthma and pneumonia, as well as for selling its device and companion software to doctors outside the U.S.\n\n“Of all the things that I invested in, Eko may be one of the most practical because you can easily use it to change outcomes,” said Vas Bailey, partner at Artis Ventures. Bailey lost his father to heart disease on his 11th birthday. “We can find more cases of cardiac abnormalities when you’re going to go see a doctor for a routine workup. Maybe as a part of your screening, we can help save your life. Maybe it could have helped save my dad’s life.”\n\nWhile no other company integrated AI into a stethoscope, other startups that use AI to detect heart conditions include Ultromics and CardioSignal.",

      "title": "Insurance provider Understory gets into renewable energy following $15M Series A",
      "content": "Back in 2014, Understory co-founder and CEO Alex Kubicek was on a mission to deploy a network of ground-level weather stations to track weather in real time and anticipate needs, for example, in terms of committing resources to an area after or during a storm.\n\nAt the time, Kubicek teamed up with Bryan Dow to create the weather stations with a goal of adding another 10 to 15 minutes to a thunderstorm or tornado warning. However, they found much of the data used to forecast weather was from the 1980s.\n\n“We needed a much better weather dataset, and that’s when I connected with Bryan Dow to build the weather station,” Kubicek told TechCrunch. “It is a solid-state measurement that measures wind, rain and hail at 125,000 times a second, as well as measuring temperature, pressure and humidity. That gives us a really deep, detailed understanding of what’s happening on the ground.”\n\nOver the next eight years, Madison, Wisconsin-based Understory would deploy the weather stations, dubbed Dot, across the globe, gathering more and more data. It also raised around $40 million in funding, including an initial $1.9 million round led by True Ventures in 2014.\n\nFlush with all of that data, the company was able to build global catastrophe models to help better understand risk to individual properties. Those models were validated by its reinsurance partners, which told Understory that it should sell this set of historical data as a software-as-a-service or data services product, Kubicek said.\n\nUnderstory Dot deployed on a dealership rooftop. Image Credits: Understory\n\nHowever, Kubicek and Dow had bigger plans. During that time, they had met Neil Irwin, who was a senior executive at one of the leading insurance brokers in the world, and decided to build their own insurance company.\n\nIrwin came on as co-founder and international president to help them learn about the insurance industry and “catapult Understory into this really exciting next phase,” Kubicek said.\n\nUnderstory began providing insurance offerings that adapt to meet the growing threat of severe weather risk, often called parametric insurance. For example, it launched a Dealers Open Lot insurance solution, which offers risk management for U.S. auto dealers. It has since provided protection for dealer inventories across the United States in nearly 1,000 locations.\n\nBy giving auto dealerships early notifications, Understory has been able to save customers hundreds of millions of dollars of damage. Irwin said one client in particular was able to reduce hail damage to cars from $110 million of damage to $50 million just by having that early notice.\n\n“In the audit world, we’re not just helping people with the climate-related risks, although that’s huge,” Irwin said. “We’ve been able to avoid 10 major incidents and about $3 million of actual losses that would have occurred.”\n\nUnderstory has seen 500% year-over-year growth over the past year. And now it is going in a new direction, launching a product focused on the renewable energy sector. It is doing this with a new $15 million round of Series A capital co-led by True Ventures and Prelude Ventures.\n\nKubicek said its proprietary risk mitigation technology helps solar farms, for example, save 50% on hail repair costs by leveraging buying power at scale. With some of its models being able to predict weather events with 45 minutes of notice, solar farm operators could have time to stow or move the panels, which deflects the hail by changing the angle of impact.\n\nThis can turn a $10 million loss into a $5 million loss, or even a $2.5 million loss into a $500,000 loss, with the right approach, he said.\n\n“The current solar industry is actually in a crisis right now,” Kubicek said. “A lot of these contracts are being canceled because the only place that you’re trying to build these large solar projects are in areas where the sky is literally trying to kill you. With our technology, we’re able to mitigate that risk.”",

      "content": "The tension between incumbents and fintechs has existed for decades. But every once in a while, the two groups decide to put their competition aside and work together.\n\nIn an unusual move, Capital One is teaming up with payment giants (and rivals) Stripe and Amsterdam-based Adyen to offer a free product aimed at fraud reduction, the financial services giant told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview.\n\nWhile Capital One has built models to protect its customers from fraud, it was getting stuck because it just “didn’t have enough data,” said head of fraud strategy Jon Borman.\n\nSo it built an open source project called Direct Data Share, which Borman said is an API that allows merchants or anyone in the payment stack to send real-time transaction data. This is particularly useful for e-commerce transactions, which he described as “pretty unsafe” compared to in-person purchases where a user is verifying the chip on a credit card, for example.\n\nWith Direct Data Share, every time an online purchase was made, “a bunch of data” flowed through Capital One’s API to the bank, which would be used to help prevent fraud for more customers and merchants, he said.\n\nBut by partnering with Stripe and Adyen with Direct Data Share, Capital One can act like a data clearinghouse, identifying fraud across all of their rails.\n\n“If we see an IP address through Stripe that turns out to be fraudulent, we can now use that same IP address to prevent fraud for transactions happening at Adyen, and vice versa,” Borman told TechCrunch.\n\nMerchants win, he said, because more fraud should be identified. Global e-commerce fraud losses are expected to spike to $343 billion by 2027, according to a study by Juniper Research.\n\nBut it should also mean fewer false declines, when a card or transaction is flagged but shouldn’t be. And merchants pay no extra fees for the protection. So far, Borman said that the partnering with the fintechs has resulted in the approval of over a billion dollars’ worth of transactions that would have been declined.\n\n“They’re trying to stop fraud on their side, too, both for financial reasons, as well because this is criminal activity that we’re preventing,” he said of Stripe and Adyen. “So we had this light bulb moment in that we realized we have the exact same business model, so we can work together and fight fraud.”\n\nCapital One has been working with Stripe on this offering since early 2023, but only recently began collaborating with Adyen.\n\nSpecifically in the case of Stripe, Capital One through its API is able to receive fraud scores from Stripe’s Radar product that it says will help it improve accuracy during the transaction authorization process.\n\nWhen Capital One approached Adyen with a solution to improve authorization rates, “it was an easy decision,” Trevor Nies, Adyen SVP and global head of digital, told TechCrunch.\n\n“We love this partnership because we can succeed together,” he added. “Adyen’s merchants benefit from higher authorization rates and fewer chargebacks just as Capital One’s cardholders benefit from fewer false positive declines and less fraud.”\n\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?

      "title": "Taloflow puts AI to work on software vendor selection to reduce costs and save time",
      "content": "Every company, large or small, needs to choose software, and the bigger the company, the more complex the exercise. Some have internal tools and processes to help narrow down the list of possible vendors and eventually make a selection. Others use firms like Gartner or G2 to help guide them through the process.\n\nTaloflow, an early-stage startup and Y Combinator alum, thinks it has come up with a better, software-driven way to help companies choose software by reducing the time to decision and lowering the overall cost of the process. On Wednesday, the company said it has raised a $1.3 million seed round and that it was releasing its AI-driven collaborative notebooks, which let its customers build custom software evaluation reports.\n\n“Taloflow replaces homegrown technology and software selection processes that can last weeks or months,” the startup’s CEO and co-founder, Louis-Victor Jadavji, told TechCrunch. “Unlike Gartner or G2, which offer mostly generic insights, Taloflow creates tailored reports for specific use cases,” he said.\n\nThe company has created a series of base reports for a number of categories, such as ERP or cloud cost control, leveraging both public information and the help of industry experts. Users can select a category, say cloud cost control, and then narrow it to a more specific subject, such as FinOps, and Taloflow will generate a report in the form of a collaborative notebook.\n\nThe basic report is just a starting point, though. The notebook works somewhat like Google Docs, and lets multiple participants edit, comment and change the requirements, as well as assign a weight those requirements in terms of importance. Those weights can have an impact on the final choices.\n\nThe Taloflow notebook allows multiple users to edit and comment on the report. Image Credits: Taloflow\n\nThe report includes the rationale behind the choices, and it can even generate requests for proposal with the requirements for vendors.\n\nIt’s worth noting that AI plays a role in these reports. Taloflow has built large language models (LLMs) that sift through publicly available information and speed up the time and cost of generating the base reports.\n\nThe founders, Jadavji and Todd Kesselman (along with Jason Kim, who has since left the company), discovered the need for a solution like this when they were part of the YC Winter 2021 batch. “We interviewed around 70 CTOs and engineering managers, and discovered that decisions regarding tech stacks — such as choosing vendors or deciding between buying or building — were becoming increasingly complex and time-consuming,” Jadavji said.\n\nThey learned that such processes were often long, and failed to find solutions that met the organization’s goals and requirements. “We decided to build a product that focuses on the specific needs of enterprises, using LLMs to scale our research, and eventually developing the collaborative notebook.”\n\nThe company says it has hundreds of paying customers, including three Fortune 500 companies. It has only five full-time employees so far, but Jadavji says he is hiring, especially analysts.\n\nToday’s funding came from Wonder Ventures, First Check Ventures and a number of industry angels, including founders from Hootsuite, Opendoor and Sacra.",

      "content": "Welcome to Elon Musk’s X. The social network formerly known as Twitter where the rules are made up and the check marks don’t matter. Or do they?\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO announced his bid to buy Twitter in April 2022, zealously driven to rid the platform of spam bots and protect free speech. Musk ultimately paid $44 billion for the website in October 2022, following attempts to kill the deal and a dramatic legal discovery process.\n\nSince Musk bought Twitter and took the company private, there has been a whirlwind of news around the microblogging platform, including but not limited to the complete rebrand to X, a new CEO in Linda Yaccarino, a major advertising exodus, the implementation of Musk’s Grok chatbot, the expansion of premium subscriptions and features, staggering layoffs and much more.\n\nA lot has happened with X since Musk’s takeover of the social network, so we’ve put together an exhaustive timeline of all the new features, platform changes and controversies.\n\nJune\n\nX tweaks rules to formally allow adult content\n\nX is officially allowing users to post adult and graphic content on the platform — with a few caveats. Users can now post consensually produced NSFW content as long as it is prominently labeled as such. The new rules also cover AI-generated videos and images.\n\nWe have launched Adult Content and Violent Content policies to bring more clarity of our Rules and transparency into enforcement of these areas. These policies replace our former Sensitive Media and Violent Speech policies – but what we enforce against hasn’t changed.\n\n\n\nAdult… — Safety (@Safety) June 3, 2024\n\nMay\n\nX plans to hide public ‘likes’ for all users\n\nX is preparing to make “likes” private on the social network.

The move essentially reinvents the original purpose of the blue check, which was to prove notoriety or identification.\n\nMarch 2024\n\nElon Musk says certain free users will get access to X Premium features\n\nIn a post on X, Musk said that accounts with more than 2,500 “verified subscriber followers” will get access to Premium features for free.

In response, Musk said the show’s “approach was basically just ‘CNN, but on social media.”\n\nX to launch a video streaming app on Samsung and Amazon TVs\n\nContinuing on his promise to make X the “everything app,” Elon Musk is planning to launch a YouTube-like streaming app for Samsung and Amazon smart TVs. Musk said the dedicated app will allow users to watch videos from X on larger screens, like the Samsung TV and Amazon’s Fire TV.\n\nX now allows Premium+ users and organizations to publish articles\n\nX Premium+ subscribers and verified organizations can now publish longer posts on the platform. The Articles feature lets users publish posts with text formatting, other X posts and embedded videos and images — similar to a blog post or a Medium article. The change comes after X increased the limit for long posts to 25,000 characters for paying users.\n\nX turns on voice call feature that could impact your privacy\n\nElon Musk launched audio and video calling on X in another bid to make it the “everything” app. The new feature is switched on by default, leaks your IP address to anyone you talk with, and can be incredibly confusing to figure out how to limit who can call you. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to turn it off.\n\naudio and video calling are now available to everyone on X! who are you calling first? pic.twitter.com/DYvB7ZRrbY — News (@XNews) February 28, 2024\n\nFormer Twitter executives sue Elon Musk, alleging owed severance payments\n\nFour former Twitter executives, including ex-CEO Parag Agrawal, sued Elon Musk, alleging that they’re owed over $128 million in severance payments. The lawsuit quotes Walter Isaacson’s biography of Musk, which quotes the X CEO as saying he would “hunt every single one” of Twitter’s C-suite “till the day they die.”\n\nFebruary 2024\n\nX goes to court in Elon Musk’s war against the Center for Countering Digital Hate\n\nX Corp is in court against the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) after accusing the extremism research organization of “actively working to assert false and misleading claims about X” in a lawsuit last year. The nonprofit, formed in 2018, conducts research on social media platforms to track hate speech, extremism and misinformation. A judge has hinted that the suit may be dismissed.\n\nX says it’s withholding accounts and tweets in India to obey orders\n\nX said it is withholding specific accounts and posts in India in response to executive orders issued by the Indian government. The company said it disagrees with the action, but noncompliance would have subjected the firm to “potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment.\n\nX will soon let advertisers run ads next to a ‘curated list’ of creators\n\nAdvertisers will soon be able to run ads next to select content creators on X. The move will allow advertisers to ensure that their ads don’t run next to controversial or offensive content, following an exodus of numerous brands from X last year after their ads appeared next to pro-Nazi content.\n\nSports betting is coming to X with BetMGM partnership\n\nX has forged a deal with BetMGM, making it X’s exclusive Live Odds Sports Betting partner and will introduce access to the betting service on X. Initially, X users in the U.S. will be able to explore the betting odds on pro football, with more professional and college sports to roll out over time.\n\nSports never sleep on @X.

In response, Swifties organized a fandom-driven campaign to bury the AI-generated content searched under terms “taylor swift ai” or “taylor swift deepfake.”\n\nX removes support for NFT profile pictures\n\nX quietly removed a feature for paid subscribers: the ability to set an NFT as their profile picture. The feature, which allowed Twitter Blue subscribers to set NFTs minted on Ethereum as custom hexagonal profile pictures, was originally launched by previous management in January 2022. Those who had NFT profile pictures still have hexagonal avatars, though it’s unclear if X will remove those as well.\n\nX promises peer-to-peer payments, AI advances in 2024\n\nIn a blog post, the company claims it will launch peer-to-peer payments this year, to unlock “more user utility and new opportunities for commerce.” X also said that AI would be used to “increasingly power the X user and advertising experience” in search, ads and a forthcoming “See Dissimilar Posts” feature.\n\nJournalists critical of Elon Musk had their X accounts temporarily suspended\n\nX temporarily suspended the accounts of multiple journalists, commentators and podcasters who have been critical of Elon Musk, including The Texas Observer’s Steven Monacelli, The Intercept’s Ken Klippenstein, MintPress News’ Alan MacLeod and The TrueAnon podcast.

The company seemingly pulled the new format hours later, but it’s now back.\n\nX launches “Verified Organizations” feature for small businesses\n\nX’s “Verified Organizations” program now has a $200 per month tier intended for small businesses.

Discovery, IBM, Paramount Global, Lionsgate, European Commission, Walmart and as of the time of this update’s publication, TechCrunch.\n\nX also lost a high-profile brand campaign with Paris Hilton’s 11:11 Media, which would have seen Hilton promoting key X features like live video, live e-commerce, X Spaces and more over a two-year period.\n\nAt the DealBook conference, Musk told advertisers who recently paused their ad spending on X to “go fuck yourself.” X CEO Linda Yaccarino later publicly backed Musk and his remarks.\n\nX introduces job search tool\n\nIn pursuit of becoming the “everything app,” X is attempting to compete in the hiring space.

Now the issue is in the hands of the FTC. Independent non-profit Check My Ads filed a formal complaint with the FTC urging an investigation over the advertising practices at X, including the lack of disclosure about which posts are ads.\n\nX changes algorithm to highlight smaller accounts\n\nX’s For You feed typically surfaces popular and trending posts from its broader network alongside highlights from those you follow. The new algorithm update instead surfaces posts from smaller accounts, according to an X post by Elon Musk.\n\nX runs ‘timeline takeover’ ad promoting anti-trans film\n\nAs part of a timeline takeover, conservative media nonprofit PragerU promoted the hashtag “#DETRANS” to advertise an anti-trans film.

It remains unclear why Circles was sunsetted a bit more than a year after its August 2022 launch.\n\nX tests charging $1 per year in select markets\n\n“This new test was developed to bolster our already successful efforts to reduce spam, manipulation of our platform, and bot activity while balancing platform accessibility with the small fee amount. It is not a profit driver,” the company said.\n\nThe company plans to use payment, phone and ID verification to stop bots.\n\nStarting today, we’re testing a new program (Not A Bot) in New Zealand and the Philippines. New, unverified accounts will be required to sign up for a $1 annual subscription to be able to post & interact with other posts. Within this test, existing users are not affected.

U.S. traffic was down by 19%. Performance had also declined 17.8% YoY on mobile devices in the U.S., based on monthly active users on iOS and Android.\n\nX now requires users to answer a question before joining private Communities\n\nAdmins of private Communities on X can now require users to answer a question when they request to join, along with agreeing to the group’s rules.

Prior to the policy change, only verified accounts would be considered for newsworthy posts. However, now that X allows people to get verified by paying for a subscription, the new version of the policy says posts only by “a high-profile account” counts as newsworthy posts.\n\nHowever, the updated page doesn’t give details on what kind of accounts are considered “high-profile.”\n\nX can now limit replies to verified users\n\nThe new control is not restricted to paid/premium accounts. Users who don’t pay for X Premium can also choose to not let non-verified users reply to their posts.\n\nThe feature originally limited replies to either “Accounts you follow” or “Only accounts you mention” in 2020, but users could only choose this setting before posting a tweet. In 2021, they updated the feature to allow users to control replies after a tweet was published.\n\nX to test its three premium tiers\n\nX CEO Linda Yaccarino discussed the plan in a briefing to X debt holders on October 5th.\n\nIt’s not clear when the three-tier subscription plan would go live, but references found in the X app’s code by @aaronp613 reference a “Premium Basic,” “Premium Standard” and “Premium Plus” plan, which have full ads, half the ads or no ads, respectively.\n\nX is cutting headlines from link previews\n\nNow you will only be able to see an image with the domain name of the link on the bottom left, which is easy to miss. The change is part of Musk’s efforts to get users to post “long-form content” directly on the platform rather than encouraging users to click out of the platform with link cards.\n\nX Corp. faces a trademark lawsuit\n\nTrademark attorney Josh Gerben and his firm are representing what seems to be the first client to sue X over its trademark — a Florida-based social media ad agency, X Social Media.\n\nThe complaint, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, states that X Social Media, LLC “has continuously used the X Social Media Mark in commerce since at least early 2016,” and has significantly invested in marketplace awareness, which included developing a distinctive “X” mark that’s associated with its social media advertising services.\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nX is shutting down its circle feature\n\n“X is deprecating Circles as of Oct 31st, 2023. After this date, you will not be able to create new posts that are limited to your Circle, nor will you be able to add people to your Circle. You will, however, be able to remove people from your Circle, by unfollowing them as described below,” X said on its support page.\n\nNew code in the X app reveals that both audio and video calls will be supported. However, the feature will only be available to those with an X Premium membership, it appears. The new findings were uncovered by tech veteran-turned-investor Chris Messina inside the X app’s code.\n\nX may no longer be a free site\n\nIn a live-streamed conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, X Owner Elon Musk said the company was “moving to a small monthly payment” for the use of the platform. He suggested that such a change would be necessary to deal with the problem of bots.\n\nMusk didn’t confirm what the new subscription payment would cost, but described it as a “small amount of money.”\n\nX launches account verification\n\nX has launched government ID-based account verification via a partnership with Israel-based Au10tix for paid users to prevent impersonation and give them benefits such as “prioritized support.” The pop-up for ID verification indicates that the Au10tix could store this data for up to 30 days.\n\nX caught running unlabeled ads in users’ Following feeds\n\nWhile scrolling the Following feed on a Mac using the Chrome web browser, TechCrunch encountered a handful of unlabeled ads amid other posts from people we follow, as well as other ads that did properly display the “Ad” label at the top right of the post. Because many of X’s ads are still labeled, this makes the unlabeled ones even harder to spot. It’s unclear if the issue is a glitch with X’s advertising platform or a deliberate change.\n\nX bans scraping and crawling\n\nThe new terms, which are effective from September 29, ban any kind of scraping or crawling without “prior written consent.”\n\nNOTE: crawling or scraping the Services in any form, for any purpose without our prior written consent is expressly prohibited.\n\nThe previous version of the terms allowed crawling in accordance with robots.txt.\n\nCommunity Notes is now available for videos on X\n\nCommunity Notes is an existing program for crowdsourced moderation. X announced that notes by contributors attached to a video will show up in all posts with that video.\n\nAugust 2023\n\nX will begin collecting user’s biometric data along with education and job history on September 29\n\n“Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes,” the updated policy reads. X hasn’t specified what it means by biometric information, but it is usually used to describe a person’s physical characteristics, such as their face or fingerprints. X also hasn’t provided details on how it plans to collect it.\n\nX allows paid users to hide their likes\n\nPaid users on X now have a setting under profile customization that lets them hide the Likes tab. The move comes after rival social networks Threads and Bluesky rolled out the ability for users to see their own likes.\n\nX confirms it’s lifting the ban on political ads\n\nX confirmed it’s lifting its ban on paid political ads — a move it committed to earlier this year, shortly after Elon Musk took over the social network previously known as Twitter. The company had originally banned these ads in 2019 under then-CEO Jack Dorsey’s management.\n\nX lures advertisers with a $250 ad credit\n\nThe company announced it would offer a one-time ad credit of $250 to select businesses when they spend $1,000 or more on new ad campaigns over the next 30 days.\n\nX makes changes to retire some of the legacy API endpoints\n\nThe company said in a post that it’s discontinuing some of the endpoints while migrating others to the new v2 API. X also said that it is retiring the legacy Essential and Elevated tiers, and customers using them will need to move to any of the new tiers.\n\nMusk confirmed the move to roll out a new way to display news links without any headline or description in a post, saying the move was coming “directly” from him. The change would “greatly improve the aesthetics,” he said.\n\nAs of right now, a Twitter card for a news article shows the headline and summary text along with the header image in the preview card of a post. If the proposed change comes through, X will only show the image with a link in a post. That means if a publication or a blog doesn’t post any accompanying text with the link, users will only see the link and the image for that article.\n\nElon Musk says the ‘block’ feature is going away\n\n“Block is going to be deleted as a ‘feature’, except for DMs,” Elon Musk wrote on X. “Makes no sense.” The post was a response to a Tesla fan account who asked whether there was any reason to use block instead of mute.\n\nX now sorts posts by like counts\n\nPosts, formerly called tweets, still appear in chronological order on profiles when you’re logged into the social network, but once you log out, they are sorted by performance.\n\nOur tests show that even if you have a pinned post, it won’t appear at the top of your profile feed when logged out, which defeats the point of a pinned post.\n\nX rolls out a new ‘Highlights’ tab for paid users\n\nX began rolling out the new ‘Highlights’ tab to some subscribers in mid August. But according to the updated support page, the company is now making the feature available to all paid users.\n\nPreviously known as TweetDeck, X Pro is now a subscriber-only product. The move isn’t entirely surprising, as on July 3, the company said that within 30 days TweetDeck would be accessible to only verified users. However, the social network was delayed in implementing the new rule by a few days.\n\nX lowers requirements for its creator payout program\n\nThe company said that creators who have garnered 5 million impressions in the last three months will be eligible for ad revenue sharing. That requirement was previously set to 15 million impressions.\n\nCreators will be able to withdraw as low as $10 instead of $50, X said. Users still need to be verified and must have at least 500 followers to qualify for payouts.\n\nX CEO claims the company formerly known as Twitter is almost breaking even\n\n“I’ve been at the company eight weeks,” Yaccarino said in her first broadcast interview since taking on her new role. “The operational run rate right now… we’re pretty close to break even.”\n\n“Our data licensing and API with X is an incredible business. Our new subscription business [is] growing,” Yaccarino said. “And then, part of my, what I would say, expertise and experience, and what I came to do, was to drive advertising at the company.”\n\nVideo calls are coming to X\n\nCEO Linda Yaccarino confirmed in her first TV interview that video calls will be a new feature coming to the service, as part of its transformation into an “everything app.”\n\nX expands its partnership with Integral Ad Science\n\nThe partnership began in January to tell advertisers if their ad is placed around inappropriate content. Now, X is testing sensitivity settings, powered by machine learning, that let advertisers choose their thresholds for the kinds of content they want their ads to appear around — and according to a tweet from X owner Elon Musk, advertisers can buy these less desirable, “relaxed” sensitivity ad slots for less.\n\nBrands can reduce adjacency to gore, excessive profanity and obscenity, targeted hate speech, sexual content, drugs and spam. Soon, X will add its “relaxed” setting, which offers cheaper advertising opportunities while only filtering for targeted hate speech and explicit sexual content.\n\nX takes over @music handle, hinting at future music plans\n\nThe @music account was originally operated for 16 years by software developer Jeremy Vaught, who grew the @music handle to roughly half a million followers. Vaught posted in anger that X had commandeered the account for itself.\n\n“Super pissed,” Vaught wrote on X, sharing a screenshot of the email X had sent him informing him of the change.\n\nX streamlines Community Notes\n\nThe feature historically provided information to users about why they were seeing a fact check appended to a tweet. After three years of development, the company says this extra context will now be removed for those who are already experienced with Community Notes.\n\nTweetDeck is renamed to XPro\n\nThe company has adopted the @Pro handle instead of @TweetDeck for the tool. However, many parts of the tool, including the help page, still have “Twitter” and “TweetDeck” mentions. Musk hinted at the change a week prior, adding that XPro will come with a “wide range of psy op plugins.” There are no details about what kind of plug-ins those might be.\n\nX now allows paid users to hide their checkmarks\n\nPaid verification was introduced last year with the Twitter Blue relaunch. The service was recently renamed to XBlue during the Twitter rebrand to X.\n\nThe idea is to help users benefit from subscription features without showing that they are a verified account. The option to hide the checkmark will show up in the “Profile customization” section of account settings.\n\nThe company has updated the help page for paid subscriptions, saying that even if you hide the checkmark it might be visible in some places. The company didn’t give any further details about those placeholders.\n\nJuly 2023\n\nWant to change back to the old Twitter app icon on iOS? Here’s how:\n\nOn your iPhone, navigate to the Shortcuts app. If you have a newer iPhone, this should be pre-installed, but if not, you can find it in the App Store. If your iPhone is running on iOS 12.0 or higher, you’re good to go.\n\nFrom the main Shortcuts screen on the Shortcuts app, you’re going to tap “All Shortcuts.”\n\nHit the blue plus sign in the top-right corner of your screen to set up a new Shortcut.\n\nYou should see a suggested action of “Open App” to build your new shortcut. Tap that.\n\nNow, you’ll be prompted to set up a new “Open App” shortcut. Next to where it says “Open,” click on “App” to search for the X app. Select that.\n\nOnce you’ve selected the “X” app, tap the share icon on the navigation bar at the bottom of your screen. This will bring up another menu, where you can select “Add to Home Screen.”\n\nGo ahead and type in Twitter instead of “Open App.” Then, tap the small Shortcut icon next to where you typed in Twitter.\n\nHere, you can upload an image of the Twitter logo. However, you probably don’t have that already saved to your phone. Just Google “Twitter icon.” We used this one.\n\nApple accepts Twitter app’s rebrand to X in the app store\n\nApple typically doesn’t allow developers to name their apps as a single character, but they seemed to have made an exception.\n\nX also changed its App Store tagline from “Let’s talk.” to “Blaze Your Glory!!” Musk himself posted a tweet with this tagline without any context.\n\nX opens up its ad revenue sharing program globally\n\nThe company announced its “Ads Revenue Sharing” program is now available for eligible creators globally. The program, according to posts by X owner Elon Musk, aims to give out $5 million in the first round of creator payments.\n\nTwitter is now X\n\nThe iconic bird logo is officially replaced with ‘X’ after Elon Musk announced the change the weekend of July 22. Notably, Musk x.com now also redirects to twitter.com. Musk also called this an “interim” logo, so we might see another logo change in the future.\n\nThe app also changed its official handle to @x as part of the ongoing rebranding. The original @Twitter handle is now inactive, and its bio reads, “This account is no longer active. Follow @x for updates.” However, the original owner of the @x handle, Gene X Hwang of the corporate photography and videography studio Orange Photography, confirmed to TechCrunch that the company took over his account without warning or financial compensation, telling him the handle is property of X.\n\nhttps://t.co/bOUOek5Cvy now points to https://t.co/AYBszklpkE. Interim X logo goes live later today. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 23, 2023\n\nTwitter preps a job listing feature\n\nTwitter hasn’t officially announced the job postings feature yet, although some verified organizations have already been able to post job listings under their bios. The job listings take applicants directly to the company’s website, where they can learn more about the position and submit an application.\n\nTwitter Notes is back…kinda\n\nTwitter Notes, the feature that allows Twitter users to publish long-form content, appears to be back on track, according to a post from Twitter owner Elon Musk on Tuesday. Musk confirmed the company’s plans in response to a user’s tweet which claimed the Twitter Notes project had recently been rebranded as “Articles.”\n\nOn Tuesday, July 18, user @FaustoChou tweeted that Notes had been renamed to Articles, signaling perhaps renewed development efforts on Twitter’s part. His screenshot showed the Notes interface, looking much like it did before, as well as other unlaunched features, like Twitter Coins. Musk replied to the tweet, confirming Twitter’s plans.\n\nTwitter shares ad revenue with verified creators\n\nTwitter will now pay creators for a share of the ad revenue earned from ads served in the replies to their posts. Twitter Blue subscribers who have earned more than 5 million tweet impressions each month for the last 3 months are eligible to join the creator payouts.\n\nAccording to Elon Musk, the first round of creator payouts will total $5 million, and will be cumulative from the month of February onward. These payouts will be delivered via Stripe.\n\nDespite the program’s significant payouts, some creators weren’t happy — and took their complaints to Twitter owner Elon Musk. In a series of tweets, Musk addressed creators’ concerns over things like the types of accounts that were eligible for monetization, rate limits and other issues.\n\nWith the announcement of new DM settings, Twitter admits to having a Verified spammer issue\n\nStarting “as soon as” July 14, Twitter will introduce a new messages setting aimed at reducing spam in DMs by moving messages from Verified users you don’t follow back to your “Message Request” inbox instead of your main inbox. Only messages from people you follow will arrive in your primary inbox going forward. Notably, these changes will also now apply to everyone who has their inboxes open to allow messages from anyone.\n\nBefore becoming pay-to-play, Twitter verification indicated a person was a public or notable figure of some sort — like a politician, celebrity, athlete, journalist or other well-known individual. By making the Verified blue checkmark accessible to anyone who purchased it, Twitter diluted the value of verification.\n\nThat apparently escalated to the point that people have become bothered by Verified users spamming their main inbox, when they had set it open to receive DMs from the blue-badged crowd. In other words, Twitter has a Verified user spam problem.\n\nTwitter CEO Linda Yaccarino is pushing back at reports that Twitter traffic is tanking as a result of the July 5 launch of a new competitor, Instagram Threads. However, on Monday, July 10, users reported that Twitter seems to be selectively blocking links to Threads.net’s website in Twitter searches, making it more difficult for anyone to surface conversations on Threads or locate users’ profiles.\n\nTwitter threatens to sue Meta over its new Threads app\n\nLess than 24 hours after Threads launched, the Elon Musk-owned company accused Meta of poaching former Twitter employees to create the new platform.\n\n“Twitter intends to strictly enforce its intellectual property rights, and demands that Meta take immediate steps to stop using any Twitter trade secrets or other highly confidential information,” Spiro wrote in the letter, which Semafor shared online. “Twitter reserves all rights, including, but not limited to, the right to seek both civil remedies and injunctive relief without further notice to prevent any further retention, disclosure, or use of its intellectual property by Meta.”\n\nJune 2023\n\nOnly verified users will be able to access TweetDeck after 30 days from now\n\nAfter swaths of users were unable to access parts of TweetDeck over the last few days, Twitter started rolling out a new version of the web app to users July 3. The company also added that in 30 days, users will have to be verified to access TweetDeck. This means only Twitter Blue subscribers, verified organizations and some folks who have been gifted verification by Twitter will be able to use TweetDeck come August.\n\nTwitter limits the number of tweets users can read in a day\n\nTwitter is putting limits to how many tweets its users can read as the social media platform suffers extended outage that has stymied users’ ability to track new posts.\n\nVerified account holders can peruse a maximum of 6,000 posts daily, while unverified users must contend with a drastically reduced limit of 600 posts. Newly registered, unverified users face even tighter restrictions with an allowance of a mere 300 posts per day, according to Elon Musk. (He has since increased the limit to 10,000, 1,000 and 500, respectively.)\n\nThese read limits impacted TweetDeck users in particular, reporting major problems including notifications and entire columns failing to load.\n\nTwitter requires an account to view tweets\n\nIf you’re not logged into your Twitter account, or don’t have one, and try to view a tweet, you’ll be presented with a sign-in screen. However, days later, Twitter silently removed the login requirement for viewing tweets.\n\nWhen Twitter started enforcing the login requirement, Musk said that he took these “temporary” measures to prevent data scraping.\n\nThe company hasn’t made any official announcement about allowing users to view links when you aren’t logged in or given any details on what measures it has taken to stop scraping.\n\nThe company made the change to its Twitter Blue page today, indicating the limit. An engineer at Twitter, Prachi Poddar, also announced the change by posting a long tweet.\n\nTwitter faces a $250 million lawsuit filed by major music publishers\n\nThe National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA), representing 17 publishers, listed 1,700 songs for which it sent multiple copyright violation notices to Twitter. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Nashville, says that Twitter didn’t take any action against these notices. The publishers’ organization said in the filing that it is seeking fines of up to $150,000 for each violation.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that the social network “fuels its business with countless infringing copies of musical ‘compositions, violating Publishers’ and others’ exclusive rights under copyright law.” It added that, unlike its competitors TikTok and Instagram, Twitter hasn’t struck a music licensing deal for the use of copyrighted music.\n\nTwitter is being evicted from its Boulder office\n\nCourt documents show that Twitter owes three months’ rent to its Boulder landlord, and a judge has signed off on evicting the tech giant from that office.\n\nIn May the landlord took it to court, and on May 31 the judge issued an order that the sheriff should assist in the eviction of Twitter within the next 49 days — i.e. before the end of July. The case number is 2023CV30342 in Boulder District Court.\n\nAs many as 300 employees once worked in Twitter’s Boulder offices, but between layoffs, other firings, and resignations, it is probably less than half of that now.\n\nThe time limit to edit tweets has increased from 30 minutes to one hour for Blue subscribers, giving users a bigger window to change their tweets and correct any typos.\n\nLinda Yaccarino is officially Twitter CEO\n\nTwitter CEO Linda Yaccarino officially started her new gig on Monday, June 5, according to a tweet.\n\nIt happened — first day in the books! Stay tuned… — Linda Yaccarino (@lindayacc) June 6, 2023\n\nTrust and safety lead resigns\n\nElla Irwin took over for Yoel Roth, who famously left the company during the early days of Elon Musk’s chaotic Twitter takeover.\n\nMay 2023\n\nTwitter launched Community Notes for images in posts\n\nThe latest feature is an effort to put more onus on crowdsourced moderation by allowing users to address scenarios of morphed images or AI-generated images across the platform where the photos are posted. The launches comes days after a fake AI-generated image about an attack on the Pentagon spread quickly as prominent accounts retweeted it.\n\nTwitter’s new API tier costs $5,000 per month\n\nTwitter API Pro for startups gives developers the ability to fetch 1 million tweets per month and post 300,000 tweets per month, and gives them access to the full archive search endpoint.\n\nTwitter Blue users can now upload two-hour videos\n\nTwitter made changes to its paid plan, allowing subscribers to upload two-hour videos — expanding the previous 60-minute limit.\n\nThe company also modified its Twitter Blue page and said the video file size limit for paid users is now increased from 2GB to 8GB. While earlier longer video upload was only possible from the web, now it’s also possible through the iOS app. Despite these changes, the maximum quality for upload still remains 1080p.\n\nThe rumors are confirmed: NBCU’s leader Linda Yaccarino as the next CEO of Twitter\n\nMusk confirmed Yaccarino’s new role in a tweet this morning (May 12), a day after he announced that he had completed his search for a new CEO.\n\nElon Musk tweets that he has found a new CEO\n\n“Excited to announce that I’ve a new CEO for X/Twitter,” Musk wrote in a tweet on May 11. “She will be starting in ~6 weeks! My role will transition to being exec chair & CTO, overseeing product, software & sysops.”\n\nTwitter released its first version of encrypted DMs\n\nCurrently, this feature is only available to verified Blue users or accounts associated with verified organizations. Additionally, the encryption feature isn’t compatible with group messages and Twitter doesn’t offer protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nTwitter now allows you to react to DMs with emojis\n\nTwitter has introduced a new feature that lets users choose almost any emoji to react to a DM in a conversation. Previously, the company allowed you to react to only the most recent DM with only a select set of emojis. CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the new feature is rolling out with the latest app update.\n\nTwitter is purging old accounts and freeing up desired usernames, according to Elon Musk\n\nAccording to recent tweets by owner Elon Musk, Twitter is purging inactive accounts that have had “no activity at all for several years.”\n\nWe’re purging accounts that have had no activity at all for several years, so you will probably see follower count drop — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 8, 2023\n\nTwitter is contemplating a cheaper verification plan for organizations\n\nTwitter is thinking about an organizational verification plan that doesn’t cost $1,000 a month. Over the Cinco de Mayo weekend, Elon Musk tweeted that the company is working on a cheaper plan for small businesses, but didn’t give any details about the cost.\n\nWe will have a lower cost tier for small businesses, but need to manage the onboarding of organizations carefully to prevent fraud. The $1000/month is meant for larger organizations. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 6, 2023\n\nTwitter confirmed Circle tweets were temporarily not private\n\nTwitter confirmed a security error that made Circle tweets surface publicly. TechCrunch reported the glitch in early April, but the platform confirmed the issue May 5 in an email sent to Twitter Circle users.\n\n“In April 2023, a security incident may have allowed users outside of your Twitter Circle to see tweets that should have otherwise been limited to the Circle to which you were posting,” the email said. Twitter claims that the bug has now been fixed, and that the team knows what caused it.\n\nTwitter makes its API free for public announcement accounts\n\nTwitter announced on May 2 that it is making its API free for verified government or public-owned services posting about public utility alerts such as weather alerts, transportation information and emergency warnings. This comes a month after the company announced its new API pricing tiers.\n\nA bug on Twitter causes legacy blue checks to reappear by updating your bio\n\nIt doesn’t seem to matter what text you’re adding to your bio — TechCrunch reporter Amanda Silberling added a few spaces, then got her check back for a moment. It even showed up with the old text that designates that she is “notable in government, news, entertainment, or another designated category,” and she did not, in fact, pay for this. But once you refresh the page it disappears. In fact, it’s unclear whether anyone else can even see your check briefly reappear.\n\nApril 2023\n\nEU warns Twitter over disinformation\n\nTwitter was confirmed April 25 as one of 19 major tech platforms subject to centralized oversight by the European Union’s executive starting this fall, when so-called very large online platforms (VLOPs) are expected to be compliant with the Digital Services Act (DSA). But the Commission has not wasted any time warning the Elon Musk-owned social network that things aren’t looking good for staying on the right side of the incoming law.\n\nIn a pair of tweets, Vera Jourova, the EU’s values and transparency VP, warned of “yet another negative sign” by Twitter — accusing the platform under Musk of “not making digital information space any safer and free from the Kremlin #disinformation & malicious influence”.\n\nTwitter now shows labels on tweets with reduced visibility\n\nTwitter said that labels will be shown to both authors and viewers. Usually, these tweets will show text such as “Visibility limited: this Tweet may violate Twitter’s rules against Hateful Conduct.”\n\nThe app’s enforcement policy says that tweets with such labels will not show up in search results, recommendations or timelines — those tweets will be hidden in both the “For You” and “Following timelines. Additionally, there will be no ads placed adjacent to posts with reduced visibility.\n\nTwitter restored Blue verification mark for top accounts, even if they didn’t pay for Twitter Blue\n\nOver the April 21st weekend, multiple top accounts (with more than 1 million followers) got their verification marks back. However, many of them, including writer Neil Gaiman, footballer Riyad Mahrez, musician Lil Nas X, actress Janel Parrish Long and British TV presenter Richard Osman said that they didn’t pay for the blue badge.\n\nIn March, The New York Times reported that Twitter was considering handing out a free verification mark to the top 10,000 brands and companies. It’s not clear if the company is applying the same policy to personal accounts.\n\nTwitter removes ‘government-funded’ news labels\n\nTwitter has removed “government-funded media” labels on all accounts, from NPR to the Chinese state-affiliated Xinhua News. The app even appears to have deleted its web page explaining the “government-funded media” labels.\n\nTwitter sends an email seemingly requiring advertisers to have a verified checkmark\n\nSeveral users have posted screenshots of an email reportedly sent by Twitter, which states that starting from April 21, verified checkmarks are required to continue running ads on the platform.\n\nWOW… Twitter is now telling advertisers it MUST subscribe to Twitter Blue or Verified Organisations to continue running ads! pic.twitter.com/4DrDu82Zi0 — Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) April 21, 2023\n\nTwitter officially kills legacy blue checkmarks on 4/20\n\nWith the legacy checks gone, the app will have verification marks only for paid users and businesses, as well as government entities and officials. Now if a user sees a blue check mark and clicks on it, the label reads: “This account is verified because they are subscribed to Twitter Blue and verified their phone number.”\n\nMicrosoft drops Twitter from its advertising platform\n\nMicrosoft is dropping the bird app from its advertising platform starting on April 25, nearly two months after Twitter announced that it will begin charging a minimum of $42,000 per month to users of its API, including enterprises and research institutions. The moves mean users will no longer be able to access their account, or create, schedule or otherwise manage tweets through Microsoft’s free social media management service.\n\nTwitter owner Elon Musk threatened to take legal action:\n\nThey trained illegally using Twitter data. Lawsuit time. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 19, 2023\n\nTwitter quietly removes policy against misgendering trans people\n\nTwitter updated its content moderation guidelines regarding hateful content, removing a policy that prohibited the targeted deadnaming or misgendering of transgender people. Enacted in 2018, the policy explicitly stated that it violated Twitter’s rules to repeatedly and purposefully call a transgender person by the wrong name or pronouns.\n\nTwitter to label tweets that get downranked for violating its hate speech policy\n\nTwitter plans to “soon” begin adding visible labels on tweets that have been identified as potentially violating its policies, which has impacted their visibility. It did not say when exactly the system would be fully rolled out across its network.\n\nTypically, when tweets violate Twitter’s policies, one of the actions the company can take is to limit the reach of those tweets — or something it calls “visibility filtering.” In these scenarios, the tweets remain online but become less discoverable, as they’re excluded from areas like search results, trends, recommended notifications, For You and Following timelines, and more.\n\nHistorically, the wider public would not necessarily know if a tweet had been moderated in this way. Now Twitter says that will change.\n\nTwitter’s new feature will let Blue subscribers post 10,000-character-long posts — as if the social network is trying to compete with a rival newsletter platform. Twitter has also added support for bold and italic text formatting.\n\nLong-form writing is also not entirely new. Last June, the company introduced a program called Twitter Notes for select writers. However, that program was shut down under Musk. After taking over the company he also killed newsletter tool Revue, a startup Twitter had acquired in 2021.\n\nNPR, PBS and a handful of other news organizations bail on Twitter as Musk meddles with account labels\n\nA PBS spokesperson confirmed to Axios that PBS had “no plans to resume tweeting” after Twitter gave it a murky “government-funded media” label over the weekend. A few other news entities appeared to have followed suit, including the prominent Boston NPR affiliate WBUR, Hawaii Public Radio and LA-based local news source LAist.\n\nThe Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC Australia), Australia’s Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), New Zealand’s public broadcaster RNZ, Sweden’s SR Ekot and SVT, and Catalonia’s TV3.cat a were labeled “government-funded media” weeks later.\n\nTwitter partners with eToro to show real-time stock and crypto information\n\nThis expands upon the social network’s Cashtag feature, which provided info about a limited number of stocks and crypto coins through TradingView data.\n\nThe new partnership with eToro goes beyond just displaying information. It also redirects users to the eToro site where they can engage in trading. If you search for a stock on Twitter, you will see a button saying “View on eToro,” which redirects to the site.\n\n🎉Very excited to be launching a new $Cashtags partnership with @Twitter which will enable Twitter users to see real-time prices for a much wider range of stocks, crypto & other assets as well as having the option to invest through eToro. @elonmusk https://t.co/Iv2q9iNxbf — eToro (@eToro) April 13, 2023\n\nElon Musk says he only bought Twitter because he thought he’d be forced to\n\nElon Musk gave a rare interview to an actual reporter late on Tuesday, speaking to BBC reporter James Clayton on Twitter Spaces. During the interview, Clayton pressed Musk on whether his purchase of Twitter was, in the end, something he went through with willingly, or whether it was something he did because the active court case at the time in which Twitter was trying to force him to go through with the sale was going badly.\n\nThe answer was that Musk did indeed only do the deal because he believed legally, he was going to be forced to do so anyway.\n\nElon Musk says Twitter will officially remove legacy checkmarks on 4/20\n\nThis is the “final date,” he said in a tweet. If the move goes through, Twitter will have verification marks only for paid users and businesses, and government entities and officials.\n\nFinal date for removing legacy Blue checks is 4/20 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 11, 2023\n\nTwitter, Inc. is now X Corp.\n\nTwitter, Inc. is now called X Corp., according to a court filing in California.\n\nSince Twitter is no longer a public company, it does not have to report updates like name changes to the SEC. But in any case, the new name was spotted in an April 4 document related to far-right activist Laura Loomer’s lawsuit against Twitter and Facebook.\n\n“Twitter, Inc. has been merged into X Corp. and no longer exists,” the document states.\n\nEx-Twitter CEO and other execs sue firm over unpaid legal bills\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, alleged that Twitter has to pay more than $1 million to the former executives for legal bills they incurred while at the company to respond to requests by the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nTwitter Circle tweets aren’t very private\n\nNumerous Twitter users reported a bug on April 10 in which Circle tweets are surfacing on the algorithmically generated For You timeline. That means that your supposedly private posts might breach containment to reach an unintended audience, which could quickly spark some uncomfortable situations.\n\nTechCrunch has spoken to multiple users who have also experienced this glitch firsthand; many more have reported the glitch in their tweets. Most often, it seems that Circle tweets are being surfaced in the For You timeline to users who follow the poster, but are not in their Circle. Others have reported that their Circle tweets are reaching even further than those who follow them.\n\nA year later, Twitter is now resurfacing official Russian accounts in search results\n\nThe Elon Musk-owned platform has resumed surfacing accounts of Vladimir Putin and the Russian Embassy in search results. A former Twitter employee told the publication that this move is likely because of a policy change.\n\nTwitter is censoring Substack links by making the posts impossible to reply to, like or retweet. While quote-tweeting works, simply pressing the retweet button surfaces an error message: “Some actions on this Tweet have been disabled by Twitter.”\n\nYou didn’t hear this from us, but if you link to a Substack via a redirected URL, it seems to post without restrictions.\n\nTwitter is rolling out additional features for Blue subscribers including showing 50% of ads in their timeline compared to non-paid users and a visibility boost in search.\n\n“As you scroll, you will see approximately twice as many organic or non-promoted Tweets placed in between promoted Tweets or ads. There may be times when there are more or fewer non-promoted Tweets between promoted Tweets,” Twitter’s description of the feature says.\n\nWhile Twitter is claiming to reduce ads on paid subscribers’ feeds, it is hard to prove if they are actually seeing fewer ads apart from anecdotal experiences.\n\nTwitter singles NPR out with misleading state-backed media label\n\nNPR’s Twitter account on the platform now comes with a tag denoting it as “US state-affiliated media.” But NPR doesn’t meet Twitter’s own definition for a state-affiliated account:\n\nState-affiliated media is defined as outlets where the state exercises control over editorial content through financial resources, direct or indirect political pressures, and/or control over production and distribution… State-financed media organizations with editorial independence, like the BBC in the UK for example, are not defined as state-affiliated media for the purposes of this policy.\n\nNPR later announced that it will no longer be posting content to its 52 official Twitter feeds, becoming the first major news organization to go silent on the social media platform.\n\nTwitter’s verification changes feel like an accidental April Fools’ joke\n\nMusk had claimed that starting on April 1, blue checkmarks that previously indicated that an account was legitimate, verified and notable would be maintained only for those who have a subscription to Twitter Blue. The change would be part of a wider push for Twitter to gate previously free features, and bundle new ones, under the $8 per month Twitter Blue subscription, which costs $11 on iOS and Android devices.\n\nAs numerous celebrities and businesses spoke out to say they wouldn’t pay the $8 fee, it appeared that removing so many blue checks would be easier said than done. Instead, Twitter merely updated the text accompanying a blue check to make it unclear whether someone was verified for being notable, or for paying for Twitter Blue. In an ultimate act of pettiness, Twitter removed The New York Times’ verification check when the news giant said it wouldn’t pay for verification.\n\nBased on early returns, the revamped Twitter Blue has yet to contribute significantly to Twitter’s bottom line, with just $11 million generated from mobile signups in its first three months.\n\nMarch 2023\n\nTwitter announces new API tiers; free, basic and enterprise levels\n\nThe three API tiers include a free level meant for content posting bots, a $100/month basic level and a costly enterprise level. Subscribing to any level gets access to the Ads API at no additional cost.\n\nTwitter mentioned that over the next 30 days, the company will discontinue old access levels, including Standard (for v1.1), Essential and Elevated (for v2), and Premium.\n\nDevelopers remain unhappy with Twitter’s new API structure.\n\nIntroducing a new form of Free (v2) access for write-only use cases and those testing the Twitter API with 1,500 Tweets/month at the app level, media upload endpoints, and Login with Twitter. Get started: https://t.co/CqCRD3vbE5 — Twitter Dev (@TwitterDev) March 29, 2023\n\nElon Musk says Twitter will only show verified accounts on its “For You” timeline starting April 15\n\nMusk justified the move by saying this was the “only realistic way to address advanced AI bot swarms taking over.”\n\nStarting April 15th, only verified accounts will be eligible to be in For You recommendations. The is the only realistic way to address advanced AI bot swarms taking over. It is otherwise a hopeless losing battle. Voting in polls will require verification for same reason. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 27, 2023\n\nNew Twitter accounts now have to wait only 30 days to purchase Twitter Blue\n\nTwitter decreases the wait to purchase Twitter Blue for newly created Twitter accounts from 90 days to 30 days.\n\n“New subscriptions to Twitter Blue are available globally on web, iOS, or Android. Not all features are available on all platforms. Newly created Twitter accounts will not be able to subscribe to Twitter Blue for 30 days. We may also impose waiting periods for new accounts in the future at our discretion, and without notice,” the Twitter Blue page reads.\n\nTwitter to kill ‘legacy’ blue checks on April 1\n\nTwitter announced that the removal of legacy blue checkmarks will begin April 1 for users that are not subscribed to Twitter Blue.\n\nElon tweeted back in December that the company will remove legacy checkmarks “in a few months.” After that, users with legacy blue checks had been seeing a pop-up when they clicked on their checkmark, which read, “This is a legacy verified account. It may or may not be notable.” But once Twitter botched this removal of checkmarks, they changed the copy again — as of now, users cannot distinguish whether someone has a checkmark because they paid, or because they were deemed notable.\n\nOn April 1st, we will begin winding down our legacy verified program and removing legacy verified checkmarks. To keep your blue checkmark on Twitter, individuals can sign up for Twitter Blue here: https://t.co/gzpCcwOpLp Organizations can sign up for https://t.co/RlN5BbuGA3… — Twitter Verified (@verified) March 23, 2023\n\nTwitter’s privacy-preserving Tor service goes dark\n\nTwitter’s Tor service, a version of the site that could be accessed even in countries where the social network is banned, has gone dark after the company failed to renew its certificate, which expired on March 6.\n\nPavel Zoneff, director of strategic communications at the Tor Project, told TechCrunch that the site “is no longer available seemingly with no plans to renew.”\n\nTwitter Blue is now available in more than 20 countries\n\nThis expansion makes the social network’s subscription service available in more than 35 countries across the world.\n\nThese countries include Netherlands, Poland, Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, Romania, Czech Republic, Finland, Denmark, Greece, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Slovakia, Latvia, Slovenia, Estonia, Croatia, Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus.\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nLayoffs continue\n\nTwitter laid off more than 200 employees in its fourth round of cuts, including loyalist Esther Crawford — the chief executive of Twitter payments who oversaw the company’s Twitter Blue verification subscription.\n\nTwitter’s staff is down from about 7,500 employees to less than 2,000 since Musk.\n\nLots of speculation among ex employees that Musk must be about to install a whole new regime and that’s why he is cleaning house. Otherwise the cuts don’t make sense. “Hard to keep the lights on with the people who are still left,” one ex manager told me. — Alex Heath (@alexeheath) February 26, 2023\n\nOne of the numerous rounds of cuts eliminated the platform’s entire accessibility team. Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) called on Elon Musk to bring the accessibility team back in an open letter. Markey requested a response by March 17.\n\nTwitter allows cannabis ads in states where it’s legal\n\nAfter updating its ad policy on February 15, Twitter became the first social media app in the U.S. to allow cannabis advertising. Cannabis ads will run on Twitter in U.S. states where cannabis is legal and in Canada.\n\nTwitter delays launch of its new API platform…again\n\nThe initial date set to cut free access to Twitter’s API was February 9, which was then extended to February 13. Now, the social network has delayed the shutdown again, this time with no date set.\n\nThere has been an immense amount of enthusiasm for the upcoming changes with Twitter API. As part of our efforts to create an optimal experience for the developer community, we will be delaying the launch of our new API platform by a few more days. More information to follow… — Twitter Dev (@TwitterDev) February 13, 2023\n\nThe delay jeopardizes the plans of developers and startups building tools around the Twitter API as they wouldn’t have any clarity on future spending and budget allocation on the developer platform.\n\nTwitter’s basic tier of its API will cost $100 per month\n\nThe company originally planned to shut down free access to its API on February 9. Now it has extended this deadline to February 13. Twitter said that it will charge $100 per month for the basic tier of API. This will get developers access to a “low level of API usage,” as well as the Ads API.\n\nWe have been busy with some updates to the Twitter API so you can continue to build and innovate with us. We’re excited to announce an extension of the current free Twitter API access through February 13. Here’s what we’re shipping then 🧵 — Twitter Dev (@TwitterDev) February 8, 2023\n\nWhen developers trying to seek clarity around the new API rules went to the developer forum website, they found that the site had been put behind a login. The forum was finally accessible four days later on February 13.\n\nTwitter Blue introduces 4,000-character tweets\n\nTwitter announced the ability to post longer tweets for paid users on February 8. Instead of being limited to 280 characters, paying Blue subscribers can post tweets that are up to 4,000 characters.\n\nWhile only Twitter Blue subscribers can post long tweets, all users will be able to read them. You will see only the first 280 characters on the timeline, and if you want to read more, you can click on “Show more.”\n\nneed more than 280 characters to express yourself? we know that lots of you do… and while we love a good thread, sometimes you just want to Tweet everything all at once. we get that. so we’re introducing longer Tweets! you’re gonna want to check this out. tap this 👉… — Twitter Blue (@TwitterBlue) February 8, 2023\n\nElon Musk claims Twitter will start sharing ad revenue with creators\n\nElon Musk announced in a tweet on February 3 that the company would soon begin sharing advertising revenue with creators on the platform for the first time. He follows up the announcement with a catch: Eligible users must be signed up for Twitter Blue.\n\nPayouts have yet to reach creators’ wallets.\n\nMore monetization pushes: Twitter Blue expands new countries, brings back Spaces curation\n\nTwitter Blue subscriptions are now available in Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain, making it 12 regions in total to which users can subscribe to it as of February 2. On February 8, Twitter Blue extended services further to India, Indonesia and Brazil.\n\nTwitter also announced launching a new Spaces tab with curated stations for live and recorded spaces, along with podcasts. The social network is making podcasts available only to Blue subscribers and “some people on Twitter for iOS and Twitter for Android apps.”\n\nTwitter to end free access to its API\n\nTwitter will discontinue offering free access to the Twitter API starting February 9 and will launch a paid version, Twitter said as it looks for more avenues to monetize the platform.\n\nStarting February 9, we will no longer support free access to the Twitter API, both v2 and v1.1. A paid basic tier will be available instead 🧵 — Twitter Dev (@TwitterDev) February 2, 2023\n\nA week later and days before the February 9 deadline, Elon Musk said that after getting feedback from developers, Twitter will provide a write-only API for “bots providing good content that is free.”\n\nTwitter discontinues CoTweets\n\nTwitter announced February 1 that it is discontinuing CoTweeting, a feature that allowed two users to co-author a tweet. Users will be able to view the set of co-tweets for a month. After that, they will be automatically converted to retweets on the co-author’s profile.\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nTwitter partners with DoubleVerify and IAS on brand safety initiative\n\nDue to declining ad revenue and advertiser exits, Twitter announced on January 25 that it has teamed up with adtech companies DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science (IAS) to tell advertisers if their ad is placed around inappropriate content. The program, available first for U.S.-based advertising campaigns, allows brands to analyze the content adjacent to — primarily tweets above and below the ad — all types of ads, including promoted tweets.\n\nTwitter rolls out its bookmark feature on iOS\n\nThe new design displays the bookmark button under the expanded tweet view, making it easier to add a post to your bookmarks.\n\nBefore the change, you had to tap on the share button to open the sharing card and then tap on the bookmark option to save a tweet. In addition to the new button, as soon as you tap on the button, you will see a banner at the top of the screen that says “Show all bookmarks.”\n\nThe option is currently visible only on the iOS app, but we can expect that Twitter will roll this out to Android and the web soon.\n\nImage Credits: Twitter Image Credits: Twitter\n\nTwitter quietly bans third-party clients\n\nAfter cutting off prominent app makers like Tweetbot and Twitterific, Twitter quietly updated its developer terms to ban third-party clients altogether on January 19.\n\nThe “restrictions” section of the company’s developer agreement was updated with a clause prohibiting “use or access the Licensed Materials to create or attempt to create a substitute or similar service or product to the Twitter Applications.” Earlier in the week, the company said that it was “enforcing long-standing API rules” in disallowing clients access to its platform but didn’t cite which specific rules developers were violating.\n\nAs a result, third-party Twitter clients began offloading their apps from App Stores.\n\nTwitter now offers an annual Blue subscription\n\nUsers now have a chance to get a discount for $84/year if they purchase an annual Blue subscription on the web.\n\nTwitter Blue, including the new annual plan, is currently available in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.\n\nImage Credits: Twitter Image Credits: Twitter\n\nTwitter HQ furniture auctions\n\nIn a strange attempt to make money, Twitter is auctioning off surplus office furniture (auction is now closed) that it doesn’t need anymore, now that thousands of employees have either left the company or been laid off. When you’re rapidly losing advertisers and apparently not paying your rent, why not go for the hail mary?\n\nTwitter makes algorithmic “For You” timeline the default\n\nThe company has tried to pull this stunt previously, only to give the option to switch back to a chronological timeline after a lot of backlashes.\n\nWhat’s different this time? The Elon Musk-led company is now showing both algorithmic and chronological feeds side-by-side. Users can switch between them by swiping on their phone screens. Until now, users had to tap on the sparkle icon in the top-right corner to switch between the “Home” and “Latest” timelines. Twitter is justifying its latest change by saying that users can now easily swipe between the renamed “For You” and “Following” timelines.\n\nJanuary 13: Twitter rolled out the dual-timeline update to the web but at that time the social network used to remember your choice.\n\nJanuary 20: The company made the “For You” feed default on the web when users first opened Twitter in a tab or refreshed the page.\n\nJanuary 24: Now, Twitter remembers your choices again.\n\nFebruary 7: Twitter remembers your choices again on iOS and Android , too.\n\nYou can now easily switch between “For you” and “Following” on web. Android coming soon 👀 — Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) January 13, 2023\n\nTwitter’s advanced search filters for mobile are said to be coming soon\n\nAccording to social media analyst Matt Navarra, Twitter’s advanced search filters for mobile are coming soon.\n\nHere’s what it looks like:\n\nNEW! Twitter Advanced Search feature on iOS is coming soon 👀👇 https://t.co/ae56yE3JTU pic.twitter.com/xbQUpQJAlS — Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) January 4, 2023\n\nTwitter lifts the political ad ban to bolster revenue\n\nThe company originally enforced the ban back in 2019. At that time, it said that “political message reach should be earned, not bought.” Twitter charted a different path from other social networks like Facebook and Instagram, which allowed political ads.\n\nThe company’s announcement to lift the political ad ban comes at a time when advertisers have been pulling back spending on the platform, and the company has been cutting down its internal revenue projections.\n\nDecember 2022\n\nTwitter Blue users can now upload 60-minute videos\n\nOn December 23, the Twitter Blue page was updated declaring that subscribers can now upload 60-minute videos from the web at 1080p resolution and 2GB in file size.\n\nLayoffs continue, impacting employees in public policy, engineering\n\nAccording to posts on Twitter and LinkedIn from a former public policy employee on December 22, Twitter cut half of its public policy team.\n\nThe company also laid off some engineers in infrastructure via email on December 16. Across all of Twitter, it’s estimated that about 75% of employees have either chosen to leave or have been laid off since Elon Musk took ownership of the company in October.\n\nTwitter now displays stock and cryptocurrency prices directly in search results\n\nTo access the new feature, users have to just type the dollar symbol followed by the relevant ticker symbol, e.g. “$GOOG” or “$ETH” (minus the quote marks), in the search bar and Twitter will display the current price. This also works without using the $ symbol in some instances, but it’s less consistent and doesn’t always return the stock or crypto prices as requested.\n\nIf someone wants to know more details about a stock or cryptocurrency, they can hit the “View on Robinhood” button.\n\nYou can now see how many people view your tweets\n\nA tweet’s View Count will be visible to everyone, not just the owner of the account.\n\n“Twitter is rolling out View Count, so you can see how many times a tweet has been seen! This is normal for video,” Elon Musk wrote in a tweet. “Shows how much more alive Twitter is than it may seem, as over 90% of Twitter users read, but don’t tweet, reply or like, as those are public actions.”\n\nTwitter Blue for Business now allows companies to identify their employees\n\nTwitter’s product manager Esther Crawford said the social media platform is launching a pilot program for Blue for Business with select businesses. The company plans to expand this to more organizations next year.\n\nWe’re launching the pilot of Blue for Business so beginning today you’ll start seeing company badges on select profiles. We’ll soon be expanding the program and look forward to having more businesses added in the new year! https://t.co/ytnMRO5rcE — Esther Crawford ✨ (@esthercrawford) December 19, 2022\n\nTwitter goes on an account suspension spree, including prominent journalists\n\nA day after Twitter crafted a new policy to explain its decision to ban an account that tracks Elon Musk’s private jet, Twitter also suspended its open source competitor Mastodon from the service.\n\nWithin the same day, Twitter suspended a number of prominent journalists on the platform without warning. “Same doxxing rules apply to ‘journalists’ as to everyone else,” Elon Musk tweeted in a reply about the journalists’ suspensions.\n\nThe company seemingly had a glitch that allowed banned users to still participate in Twitter Spaces. A group of the banned journalists started a group conversation on Spaces where Musk himself joined in. Shortly after, the app pulled its Spaces group audio feature temporarily.\n\nTwitter shuts down Revue, its newsletter platform\n\nRevue, the newsletter platform acquired by Twitter in January 2021, sent a message to newsletter writers on December 14 declaring, “We’ve made the difficult decision to shut down Revue.” Writers had until January 18, 2023 to retrieve their data before everything was deleted.\n\nTwitter disperses the Trust & Safety Council\n\nTwitter dispersed the advisory group consisting of roughly 100 independent researchers and human rights activists from around the world. The council members received an email on Monday, December 12 from the company saying that the Trust & Safety Council is “not the best structure” to get external insights into the company product and policy strategy.\n\nElon Musk says Twitter will remove all legacy verifications ‘in a few months’\n\nTwitter will remove all legacy blue checkmarks “in a few months,” Elon Musk tweeted on December 12. Before Musk bought Twitter, checkmarks were used to verify individuals and entities as active, authentic and notable accounts of interest.\n\nThis past week, many blue checkmark holders have been seeing a pop-up when they click on their blue checkmark that reads, “This is a legacy verified account. It may or may not be notable.”\n\nTwitter Blue relaunches with new verification process, plus Blue for Business\n\nTwitter is officially bringing back the Twitter Blue subscription on December 12, starting in five countries before rapidly expanding to others. The app updated its terms to specify that users will need to verify their phone numbers before purchasing the Twitter Blue subscription.\n\nWeb sign-ups will cost $8 per month and iOS sign ups will cost $11 per month for “access to subscriber-only features, including the blue checkmark,” per a tweet from the company account. Twitter Blue became available on Android at the same price as iOS in January 2023.\n\nIn addition to the relaunch of Twitter Blue, the company also began rolling out a new offering called Blue for Business that adds a gold checkmark to company accounts.\n\nTwitter’s Community Notes feature is now global\n\nCommunity Notes, previously known as Birdwatch, are now visible around the world. Community Notes is the social media giant’s crowdsourced fact-checking system.\n\nModerators who are part of the program can add notes to tweets to add context and users can then vote if they determine the context to be helpful. Prior to this global expansion, Community Notes were only visible to users in the U.S. Twitter added moderators from the U.K., Ireland, Australia and New Zealand in January 2023.\n\nTwitter announces charging $11 on iOS for Blue subscription to offset App Store fees\n\nWhen Twitter launched its new subscription plan with a verification mark on November 9, it charged users $7.99 per month. In an attempt to offset App Store fees, the company is charging iOS users $11 for the new subscription plan — though the Twitter Blue plan is on halt.\n\nNovember 2022\n\nThe platform’s crowdsourced fact-checking system, Community Notes, are notes written by users that are appended to tweets to provide further clarification and context.\n\nThe Community Notes algorithm change involves scoring notes where contributors explain why a tweet shouldn’t be deemed misleading.\n\nTwitter announces a new multicolored verification system\n\nElon Musk announces that Twitter will tentatively roll out a new multicolored verification system where companies will get a gold checkmark, government officials will get a grey checkmark and the blue checkmark will be dedicated to individuals even if they are not celebrities. That means the blue checkmark will be used with legacy verified accounts and folks who buy the company’s proposed $8 per month paid plan.\n\nIf you’re confused about all the checkmarks, you’re not alone. Here’s a quick guide on what each checkmark and badge means.\n\nTwitter Blue verification chaos ensues\n\nOn November 9, CEO Elon Musk floated changes to Twitter’s system for verifying user accounts, including charging $8 per month for it. The social media company seemingly began rolling out a new tier of Twitter Blue, its premium subscription service. According to a tweet by Esther Crawford, a former product lead, the new Twitter Blue plan wasn’t yet live, but some users saw notifications as part of a live test.\n\nThe new Blue isn’t live yet — the sprint to our launch continues but some folks may see us making updates because we are testing and pushing changes in real-time. The Twitter team is legendary. 🫡 New Blue… coming soon! https://t.co/ewTSTjx3t7 — Esther Crawford ✨ (@esthercrawford) November 5, 2022\n\nThe company also launched grey-colored official checkmarks for notable accounts such as companies and politicians. But within hours of the launch, Elon Musk killed it. Crawford clarified that the grey “Official” labels are still going out as part of the new Twitter Blue product.\n\nThe new $8 Twitter Blue plan began rolling out to iOS users in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the U.K with the only feature available at the time being the blue “verified” checkmark. This caused a number of fake accounts pretending to be celebrities, brands and otherwise influential people to create accounts and spread misinformation.\n\nThe Twitter exodus begins with mass layoffs and exits\n\nElon Musk laid off 3,700 people on November 3, almost half its staff, shortly after completing the acquisition. Twitter was sued in a class action lawsuit in response to not giving employees advance notice of a mass layoff, alleging Twitter violated worker protection laws.\n\nA week later, the app reached out to some former employees to return as they were laid off “by mistake.”\n\nIn addition to layoffs, a round of executive departures also swept through the company. In Musk’s first email to his new staff, he talked about ending remote work and making the fight against spam a priority.\n\nOctober 2022\n\nElon Musk is revamping Twitter’s verification system\n\nTwitter begins overhauling a new and more expensive version of Twitter Blue, the platform’s paid plan, that will reportedly cost $19.99 per month and give users a verified badge. At the time, Twitter Blue cost $4.99 per month in the U.S.\n\nAccording to a report from The Verge, the company plans to remove verification badges from current holders if they don’t pay for Twitter Blue within 90 days of launching the new verification system.\n\nElon Musk officially owns Twitter\n\nElon Musk closed on his $44 billion acquisition of the bird app on October 27, 2022. The deal came after months of legal drama, bad memes and will-they-or-won’t-they-chaos. After sealing the deal, Musk took Twitter private and began clearing house. On day one, he fired former CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, general counsel Sean Edgett and head of Legal, Trust and Safety Vijaya Gadde.",

      "title": "What to expect from Apple’s AI-powered iOS 18 at WWDC 2024",
      "content": "Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference next week promises to be a pivotal moment in the iPhone maker’s history. Though the Vision Pro debuted at last year’s event, don’t expect hardware to be the main attraction at WWDC 2024, which kicks off Monday at 10 a.m. PT.\n\nWWDC is for developers, and much of the focus will be on iOS 18. The Cupertino tech giant will showcase how it’s chosen to integrate AI technology into its devices and software, including through a historic partnership with OpenAI. As the big event nears, all sorts of leaks have emerged about what iOS 18 and its rumored AI-powered apps and features have in store.\n\nAmong the changes, Apple is said to be powering some of its new AI features with its Ajax LLM. Other reports indicate that Apple plans to process data from AI in a way that even employees won’t be able to access, which would help Apple continue to deliver on its promise of data privacy for its users.\n\nBelow, we’ll take a look at how Apple is said to be adding AI to its apps and services in the next big update for the iPhone, alongside other improvements and changes coming to iOS 18.\n\nSiri’s AI-enabled future\n\nApple’s digital assistant is prepared to get an AI revamp. The digital assistant will leverage Apple’s own large language models and will allow Siri to control individual features inside applications. This will work without any necessary setup by developers or users, like App Intents or Siri Shortcuts currently require. Instead, users will be able to ask Siri to do things like delete an email or edit a photo.\n\nSome of Siri’s upgraded AI capabilities won’t be ready until next year. For example, the ability for Siri to handle tasks with multiple steps is likely delayed.\n\nA more advanced Siri will also come to Apple Watch for on-the-go use. You could use Siri on your Watch to play music on another device, one report said.\n\nSiri will receive more natural-sounding voices.\n\nSiri will be able to summarize notifications that include people, companies, calendar events, locations, dates and more.\n\nCould Siri’s new look be hinted at in the animations below?\n\nGet ready for an action packed #WWDC24 next week! pic.twitter.com/8ttYkFJdQI — Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) June 3, 2024\n\nApple Photos’ new look\n\nA new interface is being teased.\n\nPeople will have the ability to retouch photos with AI, perhaps challenging Google Photos in this area.\n\nA “Clean Up” feature would, for instance, let you remove objects from your photos using generative AI technology, similar to Google’s Magic Eraser.\n\nOne report noted that Apple made an internal-only application called Generative Playground that uses GenAI to create and edit images. It’s unclear how this functionality will be presented to end users, though iMessage integration was spotted in the form of an app extension.\n\nSafari with more AI\n\nAI recaps of Safari web pages and news articles will be available through a new Intelligent Search feature. (Watch out, Arc?)\n\nNotes injected with AI\n\nUsers will be able to ask for AI recaps of Notes.\n\nGenAI will also help to transcribe audio in Notes.\n\nIn-app audio recording will be supported alongside audio transcription and AI summarization.\n\nMath Notes will help users create graphs and solve equations through AI by recognizing the text of mathematical equations and then helping you to solve them.\n\nNotes users may also have the option to auto-complete their mathematical equations when typing.\n\nProject Greymatter is the code name for a set of AI tools that are being integrated into core like Safari, Photos and Notes, Bloomberg reported.\n\nVoice Memos transcriptions\n\nReal-time transcription for voice memos is also coming.\n\niMessages’ gets an AI makeover\n\nGenerative AI emojis will be supported, letting users create their own emojis with technology.\n\nAI recaps of missed texts will also be available.\n\nOverall deeper Siri integration is expected.\n\nTapbacks will get new icons.\n\nMessage effects for individual words will be supported in addition to effects for the message itself.\n\nMessages will offer suggested replies generated by Apple’s on-device Ajax LLM to make texting back easier.\n\nRCS support is also expected to arrive this year to bring read recipes, typing indicators and high-quality video and images when texting with Android users via iMessage.\n\nCalendar refresh\n\nApple’s LLM will be able to communicate with the Calendar app to check for events when composing responses to messages.\n\nMail with support for AI\n\nMail will also get suggested email replies generated by Ajax.\n\nNew Settings interface\n\nSettings will hopefully get less confusing with a revamped interface and updates that include better organization and improved search.\n\nA new Music widget will be available — possibly to feature larger artwork?\n\nImprovements to HomeKit for smart home integrations.\n\nNotifications\n\nAI recaps of missed notifications will be available.\n\nApple is working on something called “Enhanced” notifications.\n\nSpotlight\n\nSpotlight is expected to get faster, more reliable search.\n\niOS 18 will bring the ability to place app icons wherever you want, instead of having to align them to the grid without spaces in between them.\n\nUsers will also be able to change the color of app icons, perhaps as Apple’s answer to Google’s Material You.\n\nMaps with route creation\n\nMaps will support custom route creation in iOS 18, which lets users design their own routes for a trip.\n\nMusic with AI-powered playlists\n\nApple Music may take on Spotify with its own AI-powered auto-generated playlists.\n\nMore improvements\n\nOther apps with planned updates include Freeform, Xcode and Apple’s productivity apps, like Keynote and Pages, which may get GenAI features.\n\nWe’re launching an AI newsletter!

      "content": "Google has acquired Cameyo, a company developing virtualization tools to run Windows apps on ChromeOS devices, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nIn a blog post, Cameyo CEO Andrew Miller and Google product lead Naveen Viswanatha wrote that the buy will benefit ChromeOS, Google’s lightweight Linux-based operating system, by giving ChromeOS users greater access to Windows apps “without the hassle of complex installations or updates.”\n\n“By combining the power of ChromeOS with Cameyo’s innovative virtual application delivery technology, we are empowering businesses to modernize their IT infrastructure while preserving their investments in existing software,” Miller and Viswanatha wrote.\n\nCameyo CTO Eyal Dotan founded the startup in 2018, aiming to create a platform to virtualize Windows apps so that they could run on non-Windows machines and even within web browsers. Cameyo’s approach works by packaging an app, inclusive of its dependencies, in an standalone, self-contained executable that also has a virtualization engine to run on a range of operating systems.\n\nLast year, perhaps foreshadowing the acquisition, Google partnered with Cameyo to launch features including Windows app local file system integration and the ability to deliver virtual Windows apps as progressive web apps, or apps hosted in datacenters that run in browsers.\n\nAs The Verge’s Tom Warren notes in his piece on Cameyo on Wednesday, Google’s been on a mission to push ChromeOS in business and education after a rather lukewarm response from consumers. With Cameyo’s tech, organizations looking to move away from Windows — or work with both Windows and ChromeOS — have a potentially more appealing avenue, particularly as more and more apps move to the cloud and web-based technologies.\n\nIndeed, Cameyo claims on its website that hundreds of organizations, including school districts and financial institutions, already rely on its software.",

      "title": "Cameo fumbles on Ms. Rachel fundraiser as fans receive credits instead of videos",
      "content": "Ms. Rachel isn’t a household name, but if you spend a lot of time with toddlers, she might as well be a rockstar. She’s like Steve from Blues Clues for the next generation – instead of a network TV show, she has a YouTube channel with 10 million subscribers.\n\nMs. Rachel – a music teacher named Rachel Accurso – decided to use her platform for good. She set up a fundraiser for Save the Children’s Emergency Fund, which supports children in Gaza, Ukraine, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan and other embattled areas. She called the initiative “Messages for Littles to Help Littles,” and the idea was simple: she would sell 500 Cameo videos at $100 a pop, then donate all of the money. She sold out fast, then put requests on hold while she caught up with the backlog of 500 personalized videos.\n\nBut on Cameo, if a creator doesn’t fulfill their video requests within seven days, then the person who purchased the video gets a refund. And for a full-time content creator and graduate student in early childhood education, that’s not much time to record 500 personalized videos. If reputable creators like Ms. Rachel can’t have time to fulfill a sudden burst of requests, then is Cameo even an effective platform for fundraising?\n\nOne parent, who reached out to TechCrunch, noted that he was refunded with a Cameo credit; this was especially frustrating because he only bought the Cameo because he thought the money would be going to charity.\n\nBut Cameo says that due to Apple’s policies, any purchase made as an in-app purchase on an Apple device can only be refunded as a credit.\n\n“Recently, we have encountered an unprecedented demand for Ms. Rachel’s Cameo requests, which led to some concerns regarding bookings made through our app,” said Cameo CEO Steven Galanis in a statement to TechCrunch. “As all purchases made through the iOS app are processed directly by Apple, Cameo does not have access to issue refunds. If you prefer a refund over Cameo credits, you can request it from Apple directly.”\n\nWhen TechCrunch reached out to Ms. Rachel’s management for comment, they contacted Cameo to rectify the situation. Because of this intervention, all parents who donated to this fundraiser should be getting those personalized videos for their kids. But even though Ms. Rachel and her team were not aware of Cameo’s seven-day fulfillment policy, the confusion could cause reputational harm among parents who were frustrated to receive Cameo credits, rather than confirmation of their charitable donations.\n\nCameo’s policy makes sense in some cases – if a celebrity is inactive on Cameo and someone pays for a video that they never receive, they should be reimbursed. However, Cameo was aware of Ms. Rachel’s highly popular fundraiser, since Cameo posted about it on X. Often, creator platforms like Patreon, Twitch or TikTok will cultivate direct relationships with its most popular talent, keeping a closer eye on these high-priority users. Given that Ms Rachel intended to fulfill her Cameo requests, it’s unclear why Cameo didn’t grant her additional time to do so in the first place, rather than refunding buyers.\n\n“Bottom line? Cameo wasn’t prepared for the demand and Rachel’s stardom,” a parent who bought a Cameo told TechCrunch. “Also, don’t f— with toddler parents.”",

However, due to the high demand and her other commitments, she was unable to fulfill all the requests within Cameo's seven-day fulfillment policy.\n- As a result, some buyers received refunds in the form of Cameo credits, which caused confusion and frustration among parents who wanted confirmation of their charitable donations. Cameo's policy makes sense for inactive creators but in this case, given Ms. Rachel's popularity and intentions, it would have made sense for Cameo to grant her more time to fulfill the requests or handle the situation differently to avoid any reputational harm.",

      "title": "SoftBank-backed grocery startup Oda lays off 150, resets focus on Norway and Sweden",
      "content": "It’s not just instant-delivery startups that are struggling. Oda, the Norway-based online supermarket delivery startup, has confirmed layoffs of 150 jobs as it drastically scales back its expansion ambitions to focus on just two markets, its homebase and Sweden, the homebase of Mathem, an online grocery that Oda merged with last year.\n\nOda, which has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and was once valued as high as $900 million in a round led by SoftBank in its Vision Fund investment heyday, now says its aim is to become profitable in the two countries sometime next year.\n\nOda’s retreat mirrors what we’ve seen play out in the instant grocery delivery space, where a number of startups have either sold down or been acquired for pennies on each dollar raised as they have struggled to get the unit economics to work amid sluggish growth. That all appeared to come to a major head in April, when Getir, the startup out of Turkey that raised $2.3 billion, announced layoffs and a retreat to its home market in pursuit of getting out of the red.\n\n“Grocery is the largest category in retail, but even the most capable organizations in the world have struggled to find an online model that works. Online grocery is hard — complex orders with perishable items and a multi-temperature supply chain in a highly price sensitive category,” Oda’s CEO, Chris Poad, wrote on LinkedIn last week (before the layoffs were announced).\n\nPoad’s very presence at the company is part of its efforts to get out of that “struggle”.\n\nWith past experience at Amazon, Tesco and Google, Poad only joined the company in April himself, taking over from co-founder Karl Munthe-Kaas. Munthe-Kaas, meanwhile, left after he was reportedly asked by the board to step aside due to what Norwegian media described as Oda’s “foreign fiasco.”\n\nIn short, Oda, riding on hundreds of millions in funding and the pandemic boom for online grocery delivery, had big ambitions to scale across the Nordics and northern Europe. But in 2023, the company announced plans to end its retail operations in Finland after just one year; Germany soon followed.\n\nOda may have been retrenching its own-brand expansions, but it was also consolidating with other, existing grocery retailers: its merger with Sweden’s Mathem came later in 2023 – a deal that Oda claimed would make it the largest online grocery retailer in the Nordics with “over NOK 5 billion” ($471 million) in revenue.\n\nNow, Oda’s confirmed its international expansion strategy is postponed.\n\nThe company’s state of affairs is a stark reminder of both the exuberance of investors pre-2022, as well as the difficulties that have followed as startups failed to meet growth projections.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, Oda – founded in 2013 – carved out a place for itself as one of the strong regional players in online grocery delivery in Europe. (Others include Ocado out of the U.K., Rohlik in the Czech Republic, Picnic in the Netherlands and Everli in Italy.)\n\nCue the pandemic and a massive surge of online shopping as people sheltered in place. By 2021, SoftBank, via its Vision Fund, led a $265 million round for the company at a valuation of $900 million. But by late 2022 Oda was raising $151 million at a valuation of $353 million.\n\nNow, based on recent financial reporting from Kinnevik, its largest shareholder, the company’s pre-layoffs value would have been just SEK 2.56 billion, or $245 million.\n\nLayoffs are often one of the signals not just of a company looking to cut costs, but sometimes of one looking to firm up its balance sheet ahead of a fundraise. And that’s what it looks like Oda is trying to do now, based on one report. Local publication e24 says Kinnevik and other existing backers Summa Equity and Verdane are expected to provide the bulk of the NOK600 million ($57 million) Oda is reportedly raising. It is unclear what that will translate to in terms of valuation given the other developments.",

      "content": "Zoox, Amazon’s self-driving unit, is bringing its autonomous vehicles to more cities.\n\nThe self-driving technology company announced Wednesday plans to begin testing in Austin and Miami this summer. The two cities mark Zoox’s fourth and fifth test cities, following Las Vegas, San Francisco and Seattle.\n\nThe news comes as federal regulators increase their scrutiny of self-driving car companies like Waymo and Zoox, both of which are under investigation over safety issues. Earlier this week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requested more information from Zoox to aid its probe into rear-end crash risks posed by unexpected braking.\n\nThat heightened scrutiny — fueled in part by a Cruise incident last year involving a pedestrian collision — might be part of the reason Zoox has been taking a slow and steady approach to testing and scaling.\n\nA Zoox spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company began mapping the cities this spring. Over the summer, Zoox will deploy its retrofitted Toyota Highlander test fleet with safety drivers behind the wheel “in small areas near the business and entertainment districts.” The company did not say how many test vehicles it would send to each city.\n\nZoox also didn’t say when it aims to remove the safety driver or begin commercial operations in Austin or Miami. Rather, the company is focused on using the different urban environments to fine-tune its autonomous system. For example, Austin has horizontal traffic lights, traffic lights hanging on wires, railway crossings and epic thunderstorms. Miami’s traffic lights are suspended diagonally across intersections and, apparently, the city is plagued with impatient drivers afflicted by road rage.\n\nZoox’s testing protocol is twofold: The company identifies specific pre-planned routes that offer challenging driving features and scenarios, while also randomly testing certain point-to-point routes within a defined geofence.\n\n“We always start with a focused testing area, expanding methodically as our AI gets more familiar with the unique conditions in each city,” reads the blog post.\n\nThe plans to test in Austin and Miami come as Zoox gears up for its first commercial launch. Zoox has a permit to test its vehicles without a safety driver in parts of San Francisco and Foster City, and is targeting that market as one of its first launch cities alongside Las Vegas.\n\nZoox did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for a timeline for commercial deployment or to provide definitions of the geofenced areas.\n\nZoox has become associated with images of its purpose-built robotaxi, that cute, breadbox-shaped vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals and side doors that slide open to admit passengers. The company won’t be testing those vehicles on public roads in Austin or Miami, just yet.\n\nZoox has begun limited testing of the fully driverless robotaxis on public roads in Las Vegas and Foster City and plans to start offering rides to passengers this year. In February, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) granted Zoox its driverless AV pilot permit, which allows the company to carry members of the public for free within the bounds of its approved Foster City domain. Zoox has not confirmed if it has begun doing that.\n\nZoox’s expansion news comes as the robotaxi space gets a second wind. Or maybe it’s a third wind. GM’s Cruise has also recently announced plans to test its robotaxis in Dallas and Phoenix. Alphabet’s Waymo earlier this year began offering driverless rides to employees in Austin in preparation for a planned commercial launch this year, and the company also recently announced plans to begin robotaxi testing in Atlanta.",
