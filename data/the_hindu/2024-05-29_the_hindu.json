            "text": "Nvidia's shares rallied around 6% to hit a record high on Tuesday, leaving the AI chipmaker's stock market value about $100 billion away from overtaking Apple in a major reshuffle of Wall street's biggest players.\n\nLast trading at $1,128, Nvidia's market capitalisation reached $2.8 trillion, compared to a market value of $2.9 trillion for Apple, which is Wall Street's second-most valuable company after Microsoft.\n\nIts stock surged as much as 8% to $1,149.39 during the session, an intra-day record high. Apple's stock was down 0.2% in afternoon trading.\n\nNvidia's shares have surged nearly 13% since it forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street expectations last week and announced a stock split, which excited investors as they continue to bet on the AI poster child.\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\n\"The market has been struggling to keep up with the company's ever improving growth trajectory. At a mid-thirties forward earnings multiple, this still doesn't feel like bubble territory,\" said Derren Nathan, head of equity analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nNvidia recently traded at 36 times its forward profit estimates, compared with 38 for Advanced Micro Devices and 21 for Intel, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe company's shares have more than doubled so far this year after more than tripling last year.\n\nNvidia, which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, reported a five-fold jump in revenue at its data centre segment last week as customers line up for their high-performance chips.\n\nAlphabet, Microsoft, Amazon.com and other technology companies have been competing for a limited supply of Nvidia's high-end chips as they race to dominate AI computing.\n\n\"Business is doing incredibly well, there are so many opportunities to keep growing, and the AI theme still has legs. When the song is that catchy, investors want to keep humming it all day long, said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell when asked about the stock's rally.\n\nLong considered a must-own stock on Wall Street, Apple has underperformed other Big Tech companies in recent months, falling around 2% this year as it struggles with weak iPhone demand and tough competition in China.\n\nMicrosoft overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company earlier this year as it raced ahead of other tech firms due to gains made by early investments in artificial intelligence across its cloud services.\n\nMicrosoft's shares were down 0.4% on Tuesday, giving it a market value of $3.1 trillion.\n\nApple has also been slower in rolling out generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts, than rivals such as Microsoft and Google, which are weaving them into products.",

            "publish_date": "2024-05-29",
            "text": "Congress leader and former diplomat Mani Shankar Aiyar called the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) of yore an \"upper caste\" service comprising \"Macaulay ki aulad\", which he claimed is becoming more democratic now with the flavour of the country getting into it.\n\nAlso Read: Mani Shankar Aiyar triggers row with China \u2018allegedly invaded\u2019 India in 1962 comment\n\nSpeaking at the launch of author Kallol Bhattacherjee's \"Nehru's First Recruit\" in New Delhi, on May 28, Mr. Aiyar, who literally describes himself as the \"last IFS recruit\" of the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, said the country has overcome the \"bad features\" of its first generation recruits.\n\nAt the event, Mr. Aiyar also referred to the 1962 Indo-China war as an alleged \"Chinese invasion\" but soon \"unreservedly apologised\" on the usage of the word 'alleged'.\n\nIn a brief statement on Tuesday, Mr. Aiyar said, \"I unreservedly apologise for having mistakenly used the word 'alleged' before 'Chinese invasion' at the Foreign Correspondents Club this evening.\" His phraseology, which has now triggered into a fresh controversy, saw the Congress disassociating itself with Mr. Aiyar's statement.\n\n\"Allowances must be made for his age. The INC distances itself from his original phraseology. The Chinese invasion of India that began on October 20, 1962, was for REAL. So too were the Chinese incursions in Ladakh in early May 2020 in which 20 of our soldiers were martyred and the status quo disturbed,\" Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh posted on X.\n\nMr. Ramesh, in his tweet, also reiterated that the veteran party leader has \"subsequently apologised unreservedly for using the term 'alleged invasion' mistakenly\".\n\nSpeaking on the IFS, Mr. Aiyar said, \"The IFS up to my generation and even into the 21st century was an upper caste service. It was a service made up of \u2018Macaulay ki aulad\u2019 (children of Lord Macaulay). Now, it is becoming more democratic and it has a lot of Hindi speakers... We are getting the flavour of our country into the foreign service and that I think is a very good thing\".\n\nLord Thomas Babington Macaulay is credited with playing a vital role in the introduction of English education in India.\n\nThe 83-year-old gave the example of an IFS officer that he met during one of his visits to Istanbul, who initially versed with the Hindi language only, became fluent in multiple languages within one year.\n\n\"I was very impressed on a visit to Istanbul to find a new recruit who could only speak to me in Hindi. But by the time I reached Istanbul again the following year, the same gentleman spoke fluent English and more importantly fluent Turkish. So, we are getting the flavour of our country into the foreign service and that I think is a very good thing,\" he added.\n\nMr. Aiyar, who joined the IFS in 1963 and served as Joint Secretary from 1982 to 1983 in the Ministry of External Affairs, underscored how the foreign service has now grown beyond the prejudices of its first recruits.\n\nFor instance, the growing strength of women in the previously male dominated IFS cadre, which he said makes \"half or even more of the total recruits\" presently unlike 1948. Chonira Belliappa, known as India's first woman diplomat, was the only woman to clear the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) examinations in 1948.\n\nAlso Read: The services story: On India\u2019s success\n\n\"They are allowed to get married, they are even allowed to marry foreigners... Earlier, in the IFS even a man had to retire if they married someone from abroad. One of my batchmates Sivakumar Das was shunted out to the UNDP because he married a Czech girl. I think all those bad features of the first generation of recruits have now been overcome,\" he explained.\n\nPraising Nehru for the \"re-invention\" of modern age IFS, Congress leader Karan Singh, who was also among the speakers at the book launch, on the occasion recalled how he himself narrowly missed the chance of becoming a full-time career diplomat.\n\nAccording to the 93-year-old, in 1964, the then prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri offered him to become the High Commissioner to the UK, which he declined due to his political aspirations.\n\n\"It was a tempting offer but by that time the political bug had already bitten me... I was keen to get into national politics. I have done this ceremonial post for many years. I thought that I cannot get into another post of that nature. So I very gracefully declined,\" he added. \"Nehru's First Recruit\", priced at Rs 699, is published by Hachette India.",

Ramesh (64), retired schoolteacher was living in Villupuram with his family. His parents, V. Ramachandran and R. Visalakshi, were living in their ancestral house in Tiruvannamalai town. As part of division of his property with his children, Ramachandran transferred his house, which is 504 sq.ft, in the town to his younger son and complainant Ramesh last June.\n\nIn January, Ramesh applied for a name change in the property as his father\u2019s name was in the patta. Municipal staff asked Ramesh to get necessary clearance for name change in the patta. Subsequently, Ramesh got a call from revenue assistant, B. Rahul (26), asking the complainant to meet revenue inspector, E. Selvarani (42). Ramesh met Ms. Selvarani at her office in the municipality earlier this month. The RI and revenue assistant demanded a sum of \u20b950,000 for name change in the patta, claiming the land in the locality has high market value.\n\nSince then, the duo has been demanding the money to get the job done. As the complainant Ramesh said he could not afford it as he was a pensioner, the duo asked him to pay at least \u20b940,000. As the complainant was not willing to pay, they reduced the bribe further to \u20b930,000.\n\nUnwilling to pay the bribe, Mr. Ramesh lodged a complaint with the DVAC. A seven-member team led by S. Velmurugan, Deputy SP, DVAC (Tiruvannamalai), laid a trap and caught revenue assistant Rahul red-handed. A case has been registered against him and the revenue inspector.",

            "text": "Missile attacks twice damaged a Marshall Islands-flagged, Greek-owned ship on May 28, in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen, with a private security firm saying radio traffic suggested the vessel took on water after being struck.\n\nNo group claimed responsibility, but suspicion fell on Yemen's Houthi rebels, who have launched a number of attacks targeting ships over Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe first attack on the bulk carrier Laax happened off the port city of Hodeida in the southern Red Sea, near the Bab el-Mandeb Strait that links it to the Gulf of Aden, according to the British military\u2019s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center (UKMTO). The vessel \u201csustained damage\u201d in the assault and later reported an \u201cimpact in the water in close proximity to the vessel,\u201d the UKMTO said.\n\n\u201cThe crew are reported safe and the vessel is proceeding to its next port of call,\u201d the centre said.\n\nThe private security firm Ambrey said the vessel reported by radio of having \u201csustained damage to the cargo hold and was taking on water.\u201d\n\nLate night on May 28, the UKMTO reported the Laax \u201csustained further damage\u201d in a second missile attack near Mokha in the Bab el-Mandeb.\n\nThe U.S. military\u2019s Central Command also identified the targeted ship as the Laax. The vessel reported being headed to Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nGrehel Ship Management of Piraeus, Greece, manages the Laax. A man who answered the phone at Grehel declined to answer questions about the attack and an emailed request for comment was not returned.\n\nCentral Command separately said it destroyed five Houthi drones over the Red Sea amid the attacks.\n\nThe Houthis did not immediately acknowledge the attack, though it can take the rebels hours or even days to claim their assaults.\n\nThe Houthis have launched attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in recent months, demanding that Israel ends the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage.\n\nThe rebels have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the United States Maritime Administration.\n\nShipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has declined because of the threat. In recent weeks, the tempo of Houthi attacks has dropped, though the rebels have claimed shooting down U.S. surveillance drones.\n\nYemen has been wracked by conflict since the rebels seized the capital, Sanaa, in 2014. A Saudi-led coalition entered the war on the side of Yemen's exiled government in 2015, but the conflict has remained at a stalemate for years as Riyadh tries to reach a peace deal with the Houthis.\n\nSpeaking on May 28 in Dubai, the Prime Minister of Yemen's exiled, internationally recognised government urged the world to see past the Houthis' claims of backing the Palestinians through their attacks.\n\n\u201cThe Houthis\u2019 exploitation of a very just cause such as the cause of our people in Palestine and what is happening in Gaza is to escape the benefits of peace and lead us to major complications that exist,\u201d Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak told the Arab Media Forum. \u201cPeace is a strategic choice. We must reach peace. The war must stop. This is a must. Our people need security and stability. The region itself needs stability.\u201d",

As you all know, I have never disrespected anyone or spoken badly about others. I am confident that women and young people, in particular, will respond appropriately by casting their votes on June 1.\u201d\n\n\u201cI regard the 4.5 crore Odias as my family and have dedicated myself to serving them. I have stood by them through both good times and challenging periods, including the COVID-19 pandemic, floods, and cyclones. I am delighted to see the success of Mission Shakti members. Our youth are advancing with full confidence, and their strength will propel Odisha forward, making it the leading state in the country,\u201d Mr. Patnaik remarked.\n\nThis election campaign in Odisha has become one of the most acrimonious in the State\u2019s history, marked by relentless personal attacks between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD). Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and his close aide, V. K. Pandian, have been frequent targets of these aggressive assaults. Similarly, the BJD had launched equally vehement attacks against Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan. (EOM)",

He said this would infringe on the rights of tourists who will be barred from visiting the memorial for three days.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Selvaperunthagai charged that Prime Minister\u2019s visit to Kanniyakumari after the conclusion of the campaign for Lok Sabha 2024 is meant to gain a \u2018political advantage\u2019 in the 57 constituencies, which are going to the polls in the final phase of the Lok Sabha elections.\n\n\u201cThe decision to orchestrate \u2018meditation drama\u2019 shows that he would stoop to any level to retain political power,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Selvaperunthagai added, \u201cSwami Vivekanandar propagated religious bonhomie and spread Hinduism around the world. He was loved by people of other faiths. He was a kind man. At the same time, he got the attention of people across the globe through his persuasive skills. In his famous speech in Chicago on September 11, 1893, he said, \u2018I am proud that I belong to the nation that has provided refuge to the persecuted of all religions in the world.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Selvaperunthagai also pointed out that Swami Vivekananda said, \u201cIf anyone dreams of the exclusive survival of his own religion and the destruction of others, I pity him from the bottom of my heart\u201d and that he concluded his Chicago speech by saying that \u2018Harmony and peace, not dissension\u2019 should be written on the banner of every religion.\n\nHowever, when Prime Minister Modi was earlier Chief Minister of Gujarat, thousands of Muslims were killed in riots and he behaved like \u2018Nero who played the fiddle while Rome was burning\u2019., the Congress leader claimed.\n\n\u201cPM Modi who joined the RSS as a young person and grew up reading the divisive works of RSS ideologue Golwalker, wouldn\u2019t have read Swami Vivekananda.

It plans to conduct the 40-minute class every Saturday. Activities such as conversation, dialogue, script, role play, storytelling, situation explanation, and experience sharing will be part of the spoken English class.\n\nThe proposal for spoken English classes has been made in the department\u2019s \u2018Educational Guidelines\u2019 of 2024-25, which was released recently.\n\nLearning English has been a challenge for students of rural areas, and English is essential to crack competitive exams like Joint Entrance Exam, National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, and Common Entrance Test, which are gateways to professional courses like engineering and medicine. \u201cProviding spoken English training from the school level will be helpful for students for their future education and competitive exams. It is also helpful in increasing enrollment in government schools,\u201d said an official of the DSEL.\n\nA spoken English manual should be prepared by the Graduate Primary Teacher (GPT) English Language Teachers Team to help students learn to speak fluently in English. During the third period every Saturday, students should be spoken to only in English for the entire period, the guidelines say. It also suggested that teachers should conduct spoken English classes, and if required, outside skilled resource persons may be utilised.\n\nB.B. Cauvery, Commissioner of Public Instruction, said, \u201cWe have a mega plan to introduce spoken English classes from class 1 to 10, with the Samagra Shiksha-Karnataka, the Department of State Educational Research and Training, and the Regional Institute of English from the academic year of 2024-25 in a phased manner. RIE has already developed the spoken English module and we will implement the same. But in the initial stage, the GPT teachers will create the contents of spoken English,\u201d she said.\n\nAcross the State, there are 53,782 schools, including 67,273 government and 6,479 aided schools. While the medium of instruction is bilingual in 2,403 schools, it\u2019s English in 283 schools. Most of the English-medium schools are in towns and urban areas. English-medium education is a daydream for children of government and aided schools in rural areas, and spoken English classes will be a boon for these children, said many education experts who welcomed the DSEL decision.\n\nNiranjanaradhya V.P., a development educationist, said, \u201cImparting spoken English is important, and it is a welcome development. However, the educational guide also mentions English/Hindi vocabulary. This is quite surprising. Bilingual education combines the mother tongue (Kannada) and the second language, English. Though intentions of introducing spoken English is ideal, the plan is quite confusing.\u201d",

            "publish_date": "2024-05-29",
            "text": "Microcephaly is a condition in which a baby\u2019s head is much smaller than normal. Most children with microcephaly also have a small brain, poor motor function, poor speech, and abnormal facial features, and are intellectually disabled.\n\nResearchers believe the roots of the condition lie in the peak phase of brain development in the embryo \u2014 when the cells that eventually become neurons fail to divide normally. Clinicians can diagnose microcephaly before the baby is born using foetal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nThe SASS6 gene\n\nIn particular, since 2014, a gene called SASS6 and its variants have been implicated in this developmental process. On March 19, researchers at the Affiliated Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital of Nantong University, China, presented \u201cthe genetic findings of members of a nonconsanguineous Chinese couple with a history of microcephaly and foetal growth restriction during their first pregnancy\u201d.\n\nThe team\u2019s findings reinforced the SASS6 gene\u2019s role in causing microcephaly. But more importantly, the team also found that if one copy of the SASS6 gene was non-functional, the other retained at least some function. The implication was that if both copies are non-functional, the human embryo dies before it becomes a foetus.\n\n\u201c[Our] findings confirm the pivotal role of SASS6 in microcephaly pathogenesis and reveal an expanded view of the phenotype and mutation spectrum associated with this gene,\u201d the researchers wrote in their paper, published in the American Journal of Medical Genetics.\n\nSimilarly, in a February 2024 study, researchers at the University of Cologne, Germany, reported that they modified mouse embryo-derived cells to remove all functional SASS6 genes. These genes contain instructions for cells to make structures called centrioles. But even after the genes were removed, the cells were able to make passable, if also abnormal, centrioles.\n\nThe problem arose when the cells were nudged to develop into neurons: at this point, all the centrioles made without using the gene\u2019s recipe disappeared, and the cells couldn\u2019t differentiate into neurons.\n\nConsanguinity and genetic risk\n\nAccording to Ashwin Dalal, a paediatrician turned medical geneticist at the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, 70% or more of cases of congenital microcephaly seen in the clinic come from consanguineous marriages. These are marriages between closely related individuals, such as between uncle and niece or between first cousins.\n\nConsanguinity increases the risk of an individual inheriting a mutated copy of a gene from both parents. The risk is greater if the mutated gene is rarer in the general population.\n\nMicrocephaly is caused by mutations in 30 genes. Cells use 10 of these genes to encode proteins that are required to assemble and the subsequent function of the centrioles. When a cell divides, its centrioles help form another structure called the spindle.\n\nDuring cell division, the old and new cells need to take a series of careful steps. The spindle is like the handrail along this staircase, helping the cells form and maintain their structure. For example, once the old cell makes two copies of its chromosomes, each copy sticks to the centre of the spindle, which is an elongated structure. From there, the spindle moves each copy to its two ends. Each of these ends then becomes the nucleus of a new cell.\n\nIf a cell creates centriole proteins from mutated genes, however, cell division is affected as well.\n\nThe Ile63Thr mutation\n\nIn 2004, researchers discovered the SASS6 genein the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. They also found that the protein that cells made using this gene was conserved across animals, meaning natural selection allowed this protein to exist in all members of the animal kingdom.\n\nWhen the researchers suppressed the SASS6 gene in C. elegans embryos, they found that the cells failed to assemble new centrioles, resulting in arrested development.\n\nIn 2014, other researchers studied a consanguineous Pakistani family of which four members had microcephaly. All the affected individuals were found to carry a mutated version of the human SASS6 gene on both their copies of chromosome 1: one inherited from the father and the other from the mother.\n\nThe SASS6 gene encodes a protein that has 657 amino acids. This protein assembles new centrioles during the cell division process. In the study of the Pakistani family, the researchers were able to describe the mutation correlated with microcephaly: the amino acid isoleucine at position 62 had been replaced by threonine. Thus its name: Ile62Thr.\n\nLast year, researchers at the University of Tulsa, in the U.S., introduced the Ile62Thr mutation into the C. elegans SASS6 gene. Their experiment, reported in the journal Genetics, revealed that this change didn\u2019t detectably impair centriole assembly and function in C. elegans. But when the worm\u2019s genome had another mutation that affected a different centriolar protein, the Ile62Thr mutation significantly increased centriole replication failure and embryo death.\n\nEvidently, a protein made using a SASS6 gene with the Ile62Thr mutation is functional enough to allow individuals with other unaffected organs to be born and grow into adulthood. In C. elegans, it becomes deadlier when the second mutation is also present.\n\nAt the same time, humans with just the Ile62Thr mutation don\u2019t escape unscathed: the mutation\u2019s mild impairment of centriole function still dysregulates cell division enough to cause microcephaly.\n\nScientists conducted three studies since then, including the March study, and found six more SASS6 gene variants.\n\nNeurons are finicky\n\nAs the February 2024 paper indicated, different cell types have different tolerances to a range of deficits in centriole composition and function.\n\nIn particular, the cells fated to become neurons are finicky and have the least tolerance for imperfect centrioles.\n\nThis is why, while an individual with a slightly defective SASS6 gene can survive to birth and adulthood, he/she also suffers serious brain and head deficits and intellectual disability.\n\nD.P. Kasbekar is a retired scientist.",

            "text": "Telangana Government has decided to establish an Account Rendering Unit (ARU) for monitoring and operating Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) under the alternative fund flow mechanism Single Nodal Agency - SPARSH (real time system of integrated quick transfers) of the Central Government.\n\nThe development follows the tightening of fund flow rule book of CSSby the Central Government which reportedly introduced \u201cpenal interest\u201d clause for delays in fund transfers by the States. The Centre, in a communication to all States in February, asked the Governments to ensure that their funds are transferred to the single nodal agency for CSS scheme within 30 days of receiving central funding instead of 40 days allowed earlier.\n\nInterestingly, the Central Government has been communicating the procedure for release of funds under the CSS and monitoring their utilisation by the respective State Governments from time to time since 2021. But, there has been no response from the State Governmentsince the past two years. The Congress Government which took over in December, 2023 appears to have resolved to streamline the receipt of funds and monitoring their utilisation all through and accordingly set up the dedicated unit.\n\nTo be set up in the Directorate of Treasuries and Accounts, the ARU will be responsible for monitoring of payment of CSS particularly scrutiny and payment of bills submitted by the concerned scheme implementing departments. It will handle receipts/challans and deductions made in the bills besides compiling accounts pertaining to all the centrally sponsored schemes.\n\nThe unit will submit monthly accounts to the Accountant General and ensure their reconciliation with the AG and Public Finance Management System (PFMS) of the Central Government. It will be tasked with implementation of scheme and expenditure with the implementing departments and ensure submission of reports to the Government from time to time.\n\nThe creation of the ARU follows the detailed guidelines issued by the Central Government for `just in time release\u2019 of CSS funds using the tripartite integration between the PFMS, Integrated Financial Management and Information System and e-Kuber platform of Reserve Bank of India. The Centre said the guidelines were applicable for releases in respect of all payments to the extent possible to bring about more efficiency in cash management at both the Centre and State levels.",

            "text": "The Madras High Court has permitted the wife of a person in a comatose condition to sell/mortgage his immovable property worth over \u20b91 crore and utilise the proceeds for taking care of his medical expenses as well as the maintenance of the family, consisting of a son and a daughter.\n\nA Division Bench of Justices G.R. Swaminathan and P.B. Balaji reversed an order passed by a single judge who had on April 23, 2024 dismissed a writ petition filed by S. Sasikala of Chennai to appoint her as the guardian of her husband M. Sivakumar who has been in a vegetative state since early this year.\n\nThe petitioner had approached the court with a plea to appoint her as the guardian of her husband and consequently permit her to operate his bank accounts and if necessary, to sell/mortagage an immovable property owned by him at Walltax Road adjacent to Chennai central railway station.\n\nHowever, the single judge ruled that a writ petition could not be entertained for appointment of a guardian especially when the Mental Healthcare Act of 2017 does not contain any provision for dealing with financial aspects. He had asked the petitioner to approach a civil court for such appointment.\n\nDisagreeing with the view taken by him, the Bench led by Justice Swaminathan said, in a similar case, the Kerala High Court had invoked its writ jurisdiction and observed, that it was like a parens patriae jurisdiction that could be invoked when no remedy was provided under any statute for patients in comatose state.\n\nThe Bench pointed out that the writ petitioner had already spent lakhs of rupees towards the medical expenses of her husband between February 13 and April 4 in a private hospital. Now, even at home, he had to be taken care of by appointing a caretaker and availing the services of crtical care nurses.\n\nThe petitioner\u2019s children, who had attained majority, were also made as parties in her writ appeal before the Bench and they gave their consent for appointing their mother as the guardian. The daughter broke down before the judges and said, the family would be in dire straits if her mother was not allowed to deal with the property.\n\nTaking the facts into consideration, the judges wrote: \u201cAfter an interaction with the children of the appellant, we are more than satisfied that the family is without any means and that unless the petition mentioned property is allowed to be dealt with, great hardship will be caused to them.\u201d\n\nAuthoring the verdict, Justice Swaminathan also said: \u201cTaking care of a person lying in comatose condition is not that easy. It requires funds... The petition mentioned property belongs to Thiru. Sivakumar. It has necessarily to be put to use for his benefit. The State is not taking care of Thiru. Sivakumar. The appellant is shouldering the entire burden. Driving the appellant to move the civil court, in our view, is not proper.\u201d\n\nAfter setting aside the single judge\u2019s order, the Division Bench appointed Ms. Sasikala as the guardian of her husband and permitted her to deal with his property which the Bench assumed would fetch over \u20b91 crore. They directed the appellant to utilise a part of the proceeds to create a fixed deposit for \u20b950 lakh in the name of Mr. Sivakumar in a nationalised bank and withdraw quarterly interest.\n\n\u201cAfter his demise, it will go in three equal shares in favour of his legal heirs viz., wife, daughter and son. We have incorporated such a condition only for the benefit of the family. If only there is a fixed deposit, it will ensure that at least the survival needs are met,\u201d the judges concluded.",

            "publish_date": "2024-05-29",
            "text": "The story so far: T. Arivarasupandian, 51, serving as a Superintendent in Theni district library in Tamil Nadu, had filed his nomination this year for contesting in Theni Parliamentary constituency election. However, the Returning Officer-cum-Collector R.V. Shajeevana rejected his nomination on the ground that a government employee could contest in elections only after resignation.\n\nImmediately, he filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court questioning the rejection and contended that the election laws do not bar a government employee from contesting. His argument was that Article 84 of the Constitution lists down the qualifications such as age limit, being an Indian citizen and so on for a person to be chosen to fill a seat in the Parliament but it does not specifically impose any bar on a government servant. He further argued that the question of invoking Article 102(1), which states that a person holding an office of profit under the government shall stand disqualified from being a member of the Parliament, would arise only after the conduct of elections and not before it. He claimed that the Returning Officer could scrutinise a nomination only within the parameters laid down under Article 84 whereas it was for the President to exercise powers under Article 102(1). He further said that no provision of the Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951 too prohibits a government servant from contesting elections.\n\nThe writ petitioner\u2019s lawyer M. Sathiamoorthy took up an additional plea that the petitioner was actually in service with the local library authority, which was a body corporate, and therefore, he could not be dubbed as a government employee though his salary was paid from government funds. Stating that the Returning Officer had also wrongly relied upon Article 191(1), which relates to qualifications for being a member of the Legislative Assembly, the counsel urged the court set aside the nomination rejection order and permit the petitioner to contest in the Parliamentary election.\n\nHowever, the High Court refrained from deciding the case on merits. It disposed of the writ petition with an observation that the petitioner could file an election petition after the declaration of results and raise all these grounds while challenging the entire election to Theni Parliamentary constituency. The order was passed after Election Commission of India\u2019s standing counsel Niranjan Rajagopalan highlighted the bar, imposed under Article 329 of the Constitution, on interference by courts in electoral matters and cited a Constitution Bench judgement of the Supreme Court in N.P. Ponnuswami versus Returning Officer, Namakkal (1952).\n\nWhat did the Supreme Court say in N.P. Ponnuswami\u2019s case?\n\nOn January 21, 1952, a Constitution Bench comprising the then Chief Justice of India M. Patanjali Sastri and Justices S. Fazl Ali, Mehrchand Mahajan, B.K. Mukherjea, S.R. Das and N. Chandrasekhara Aiyar had analysed Article 329 threadbare to conclude that neither the High Courts nor the Supreme Court could invoke their writ jurisdiction to interfere with a nomination rejection order especially when such rejection had been listed as one of the grounds under which an election petition could be filed.\n\nAuthoring the verdict for the Bench, Justice Ali pointed out that Section 100 of the Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951 lists out improper rejection of a nomination as one of the grounds for declaring an election to be void. \u201cThe question now arises whether the law of elections in this country contemplates that there should be two attacks on matters connected with election proceedings, one while they are going on by invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 (writ jurisdiction) of the Constitution and another, after they have been completed, by means of an election petition. In my opinion, to affirm such a position would be contrary to the scheme of Part XV (dealing with conduct of elections) of the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act,\u201d the judge observed.\n\nHe went on to state that the RPA was a self-contained enactment so far as elections were concerned and that whenever someone had to ascertain the true position with regard to any matter connected with elections, they need to look at only the Act and the rules made thereunder. He highlighted that Section 80 of the Act had been drafted in almost the same language as it had been used in Article 329(b) of the Constitution and the Section reads: \u201cNo election shall be called in question except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provisions of this Part.\u201d\n\nAfter extracting it, the judge said: \u201cIt is now well recognised that where a right or liability is created by a statute which gives a special remedy for enforcing it, the remedy provided by that statute only must be availed of... That being so, I think it will be a fair inference from the provisions of the Representation of the People Act to state that the Act provides for only one remedy, that remedy being by an election petition to be presented after the election is over, and there is no remedy provided at any intermediate stage.\u201d\n\nElections must be concluded as early as possible\n\nThe Constitution Bench also took note of the fact that if the High Courts were allowed to entertain writ petitions challenging the rejection of nominations, then the entire election process might get delayed.\n\n\u201cHaving regard to the important functions which the legislatures have to perform in democratic countries, it has always been recognised to be a matter of first importance that elections should be concluded as early as possible according to time schedule and all controversial matters and all disputes arising out of elections should be postponed till after the elections are over, so that the election proceedings may not be unduly retarded or protracted. In conformity with this principle, the scheme of the election law in this country... is that no significance should be attached to anything which does not affect the election; and if any irregularities are committed while it is in progress and they belong to the category or class which, under the law by which elections are governed, would have the effect of vitiating the election and enable the person affected to call it in question, they should be brought up before a special tribunal by means of an election petition and not be made the subject of a dispute before any court while the election is in progress,\u201d the Bench concluded.\n\nIt also observed that since the right to contest elections was not a civil right but only a creature of a statute or a special law, such a right must be subject to the limitations imposed under the law.",

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia set oral arguments for September after TikTok, ByteDance, and a group of TikTok content creators, joined by the Justice Department, requested a swift schedule. On May 14, a group of TikTok creators sued to block the law, arguing it threatens the app used by 170 million Americans and has significantly impacted American life. TikTok and ByteDance had previously filed a similar lawsuit.\n\nNvidia\u2019s market value nears Apple\n\nNvidia\u2019s shares rallied around 6% to hit a record high on Tuesday, leaving the AI chipmaker\u2019s stock market value about $100 billion away from overtaking Apple in a major reshuffle of Wall street\u2019s biggest players. Last trading at $1,128, Nvidia\u2019s market capitalisation reached $2.8 trillion, compared to a market value of $2.9 trillion for Apple, which is Wall Street\u2019s second-most valuable company after Microsoft. Its stock surged as much as 8% to $1,149.39 during the session, an intra-day record high. Apple\u2019s stock was down 0.2% in afternoon trading.\n\nOpenAI CEO pledges major wealth donation\n\nThe Giving Pledge announced Tuesday that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has joined its roster of philanthropists committed to donating over half their fortunes. This follows a turbulent six months for Altman, the co-founder of the San Francisco-based company behind ChatGPT and a venture capitalist whose $1 billion net worth, according to Forbes, stems largely from investments. His removal and subsequent reinstatement as CEO last November shocked the rapidly commercializing industry, as internal conflicts threatened to derail one of the leading voices in artificial intelligence.",

            "text": "The White House on Tuesday condemned the loss of life of dozens of civilians as a result of an Israeli airstrike in Rafah, but said it is not planning any policy changes as a result of the Israeli actions.\n\nNational security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that Israel had not violated President Joe Biden's \u201cred line\u201d for withholding future offensive arms transfers because it has not, and it appears to the U.S. that it will not, launch a full-scale ground invasion into the city in southern Gaza.\n\n\u201cEverything that we can see tells us that they are not moving into a major ground operation in population centers in the center of Rafah,\" Mr. Kirby said. Most of those killed in the Sunday strike were sheltering in tents.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a \u201ctragic mishap\u201d was made in carrying out the airstrike, adding to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths.\n\nMr. Biden and his top advisers have repeatedly warned the Israelis against carrying out widescale operations in Rafah without a plan to secure the safety of innocent civilians. But the administration made clear that it would not move \u2014 at least not immediately \u2014 to curtail any support for Israel as a result of the strike.\n\nBut other global leaders were sharper in their condemnation.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron used social media to say that \u201cthese operations must stop.\u201d The Foreign Ministry of Germany called the images of the strike \u201cunbearable\u201d and said the \"civilian population must finally be better protected.\u201d And Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could \u201ccomplicate\u201d talks.\n\nThe incident came two days after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to end its military offensive in Rafah, where more than half of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people had sought shelter before Israel\u2019s incursion earlier this month. Tens of thousands of people remain in the area, while many others have fled.\n\nMr. Kirby said Biden's \u201cnot making decisions based on popularity or public opinion polls here or around the world,\" but acknowledged it wasn\u2019t in the U.S. interest or \u201cour Israeli partner's interest for them to become further isolated\u201d on the world stage.\n\nHe called the loss of life \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and \u201chorrific,\u201d and said \u201cwe certainly condemn the loss of life here.\u201d He added that the U.S. was monitoring the results of an Israeli investigation into the strike, which suggested the civilian deaths were the result of a secondary explosion after a successful strike on two Hamas operatives.\n\n\u201cWe understand that this strike did kill two senior Hamas heads who are directly responsible for attacks,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also said many times Israel must take every precaution possible to do more to protect innocent life.\u201d\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters that Israel\u2019s weeks-old offensive in Rafah was still on a \u201cfar different\u201d scale than the assaults Israeli forces waged on other cities in Gaza earlier in the seven-month war against Hamas. The U.S. had urged Israel not to replicate those earlier attacks in Rafah, given the vulnerable civilians crowded there.\n\nMr. Miller said he had no direct knowledge of reported accounts from witnesses on the ground on Tuesday that Israeli tanks had entered the center of Gaza, and noted Israel had denied responsibility for a new Israeli strike outside of Rafah on Tuesday that Gaza health officials said killed more than 20 people.\n\nAsked whether the strike would result in any U.S. policy changes, Mr. Kirby said, \u201cI have no policy changes to speak to.\u201d\n\nPentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said she did not know whether it was a U.S.-provided weapon that was used in the deadly Sunday strike that killed the dozens of civilians at a displacement camp. \u201cI do not know what type of ammunition was used in that airstrike,\u201d Singh said. \u201cI have to refer you to the Israelis to speak to that.\u201d\n\nThe Israelis have said they used small-diameter precision munitions in the attack and have suggested that a secondary explosion caused the number of civilian deaths. Ms. Singh said the U.S. has not paused shipments to Israel in the wake of the strike. \u201cSecurity assistance continues to flow,\u201d Ms. Singh said.\n\nStill, Mr. Kirby said the incident reflected the challenge of conducting military operations in densely populated areas like Rafah, a concern that Biden and his top advisers have repeatedly raised with the Israelis.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be an investigation. They\u2019ve already said it was a tragic mistake,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re looking into it. They have been able to investigate themselves and hold people accountable in the past. We\u2019ll see what they do here.\u201d",

            "text": "A leak at Google has revealed the inner workings of its search engine and how it ranks content. Thousands of pages of internal documents from Google\u2019s Content API Warehouse were leaked on GitHub in March by an automated bot named yoshi-code-bot. Those documents were then shared by a startup co-founder Rand Fishkin earlier this month.\n\nIn an interaction with The Verge, Fishkin said a source had shared the 2,500 pages of documents with him hoping to disprove Google\u2019s \u201clies\u201d about how the search algorithm works.\n\nWhile Google hasn\u2019t responded to the leak or allegations that it was dishonest about the Search algorithm, Fishkin told the news outlet that the tech giant has not debated its authenticity, and that an employee [of Google] requested [him] to change some terms around how the event was to be characterised.\n\nThe leaked documents contain details about the kind of data Google collects and uses, sites Google ranks high for sensitive topics, and how it handles minor websites. The methods described in the documents are different from public statements made by Google executives on these subjects.\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\nFor example, while Google officials have said multiple times that Google Chrome data was not used in search ranking, Chrome is mentioned specifically in many sections as a parameter in the leaked documents. Another factor that was not deemed important was the author byline. While Google had previously stated that bylines should just be done for readers and not rankings, it appears that Google does at least keep track of this attribute even though it is not quite clear if it is a metric for ranking.\n\nThe secrecy around the Search algorithm has birthed an industry of marketing and SEO experts who help companies navigate rankings on Google. Fishkin, who has been working in SEO for more than a decade now, called out such experts for \u201cuncritically repeating Google\u2019s public statements\u201d and asked them to do better.\n\nThe Hindu has not independently verified these leaked documents.",

Kannadasan also recommended that the State government recover \u20b950,000 each from retired police personnel S. Rajasekaran and S. Ismayil, who were Sub-Inspectors attached to the Anti Land Grabbing Special Cell in Kancheepuram at the time of the incident.\n\nThe Commission also recommended the recovery of \u20b925,000 each from then head constables D. Padmanaban and L. Umasankar. It, however, dismissed the complaint against retired DSP S. Dharmalingam, who was the fifth respondent in the case.\n\nThe complainant, R. Vasuki, who was residing on the 7th Cross Street in Besant Nagar, said that four police personnel trespassed into her house by scaling the compound wall at 5 a.m. on July 11, 2013.\n\nThey pushed her and her sister-in-law, causing injuries, and said that they were looking for her husband, Rajagopal, a scientist working in the Netherlands. They said that a complainant had alleged that her husband had cheated an individual over a land deal in Pudupakkam village.\n\nThe police personnel had manhandled the occupants of the house, and hence the complaint.\n\nThe respondents, in their common counter-statement, denied all the allegations against them and referred to the land grab complaint received in 2012 and the case registered in this regard.\n\nConsidering the oral and documentary evidence and the arguments of both the parties, the Commission was of the view that it was established by the complainant that, in the early morning of July 11, 2013, four police personnel came to her house and, under the guise of an inquiry, they harassed her, her son, and her sister-in-law.\n\nThe Commission pointed out that the police personnel had entered the house without even registering an FIR or issuing a notice under Section 41(A) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",

            "text": "Google launched its AI-powered search, AI Overviews, feature in regular search for the public earlier this month.\n\nOverviews, also known as \u201cSearch Generative Experience,\u201d works by providing users with summaries of web content that are generated using its in-house LLM. And while the feature is enabled by default, it appears only when the search engine believes it can provide more valuable information in the summary, compared to traditional blue links.\n\nHowever, since its launch the feature has met with criticism for providing inaccurate and at times outlandish responses to queries from users.\n\nThe feature can also be cumbersome for users who do not wish to read summaries and prefer to access the original content that was used to generate the summary.\n\nAnd while Google has gone to great lengths to ensure users engage more and more with the summarised content, including locking down support threads where people were asking how the feature can be disabled. For those who don\u2019t want to see AI Overviews, there is a workaround.\n\nHow to disable Google AI Overviews Users who do not wish to use Google\u2019s AI Overviews in their search results can force the search engine to always show web results without AI summaries, videos, images and other search features. Here is a step-by-step guide of how to force Google to skip the AI summaries - Open Google Chrome Click on the three-dot menu in the top right corner and click on \u201cSettings\u201d. Scroll down to the \u201cSearch engine\u201d setting. This should be visible in the panel on the left. Select the search engine, then click Manage sear engines and site search. Click on the add button next to the \u201cSite Search\u201d option In the Add search engine box, enter a name for your search engine. For a shortcut, enter a keyword to quickly use the search engine from the address bar, say something like \u201cWeb\u201d or \u201cSearch\u201d. Change the URL to {google:baseURL}/search?udm=14&q=%s. Click on Add. Now click on the three-dot menu next to the new sear engine you just created and select \u201cMake Default\u201d. The search engine should now appear as your default under Search engines. Close the settings page and now when you search from your address bar in Google Chrome, it will search using Google\u2019s new Web Search feature instead of AI Overviews. In case you do want to switch back to AI Overviews, just head back to the settings tab in Chrome, and set Google as the default search engine.\n\nThese steps can be followed for other browsers like Microsoft Edge as well. However, the way to access the settings may be different.",

In his death note, has named corporation Managing Director J.J. Padmanabha, Accounts officer Parashuram and Union Bank of India\u2019s Manager Suchismita, blaming them for his death.\n\nBJP state President B.Y. Vijayendra and BJP legislator from Shivamogga S.N. Channabasappa have demanded the resignation of the ST welfare Minister and arrest of those named in the death note while the JD(S) has demanded inclusion of the name of the Minister in the FIR.\n\nThe State Government has received a report from corporation MD J.J. Padmanabha, who has been named by the deceased officer in his death note, while the police have filed a FIR against the Union Bank of India in this respect. The signatures that led to unauthorised transfer of \u20b988 crore from the corporation to Union Bank has been sent to Forensic Science Laboratory to ascertain whether the signatures were forged or genuine. The Finance Department officials also visited the corporation office on May 28 to probe the documents pertaining to the scam. The corporation has so far got back \u20b928 crore of the unauthorised transactions and is expecting to receive the remaining \u20b960 crore.\n\nMinister acknowledges scam\n\nB. Nagendra, the Minister for Scheduled Tribes, under whom the corporation functions, told presspersons on May 28 that action would be initiated against those involved in the scam while also condoling the death of office superintendent Chandrashekar. Acknowledging the scam, the Minister said that of \u20b9187 crore meant for various programmes from 2023-2024 and 2024-2025, \u20b988 crore had been transferred to an unofficial account in the Union Bank of India, M.G. Road branch, without coming to his or the corporation\u2019s chairperson\u2019s notice.\n\n\u201cAfter the incident came to light, officials who conducted preliminary probe have confirmed that it had been done without anyone\u2019s knowledge. I have set a deadline for the bank to return the remaining amount. We will get it back as early as possible. Once the CID submits its report, we will take action against the accused,\u201d the Minister said.\n\nWife demands justice\n\nKavitha, wife of deceased Chandrashekharan, has demanded justice for her husband\u2019s death. \u201cHe ended his life unable to handle the pressure at the office. He is honest and has never engaged in any corrupt practice,\u201d Kavitha told the media at her residence in Shivamogga on Tuesday.\n\nChandrashekharan, 48, who worked in the corporation\u2019s office in Bengaluru, was found dead at his residence in Vinoba Nagar in Shivamogga. He is survived by his wife and two children. Vinoba Nagar police have registered the case on charges of abetment of suicide (Section 306 of the IPC) as per Kavitha\u2019s complaint.\n\n\u201cMy husband came back from Bengaluru on Friday night. He was upset throughout the weekend. He hardly spoke to anybody. Going by the death note, it is clear that he was under pressure.

Defence Ministers.\n\nBefore returning to Ukraine, Mr. Zelenskyy visited Portugal and signed another bilateral agreement. Portugal is one of Western Europe\u2019s poorest countries and has a small military compared with its bigger E.U. partners. Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said Portugal is sending a further 126 million euros ($137 million) in military and financial aid to Kyiv as part of a broad cooperation plan.\n\nOn May 27, Mr. Zelenskyy signed a security agreement with Spain that allocates 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) of military aid to Ukraine in 2024, and 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) by 2027.\n\nThe bilateral aid is essential since the 27-nation bloc is again struggling to overcome Hungary's objections to the E.U. itself providing billions of euros in military aid to Kyiv.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 billion euros ($7 billion) are stalled by the Hungarian government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, considered Russia\u2019s staunchest ally in the E.U. Single member states have wide veto powers, and Hungary has long held up funds aimed at boosting Ukraine\u2019s defenses.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the sad thing that we have the cash, we have the capacity, but we are still pending decisions to implement\u201d aid decisions for Ukraine, said E.U. foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.\n\nMr. Zelenskyy met with Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, and as well as the immediate money, he obtained a security agreement aimed at providing guarantees of military help until Ukraine joins NATO.\n\nSince Russia launched a spring offensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region, Mr. Zelenskyy has insisted Ukraine urgently needs seven more U.S.-made Patriot air defence systems.\n\nMr. Putin says the Kremlin's forces are seeking to establish a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d in Kharkiv to prevent Ukraine launching attacks across the border there.\n\nDutch Defence Minister Kajsa Ollongren, meeting with her E.U. colleagues, said a Patriot system will be built \u201cin a short time frame.\u201d The Netherlands has the core components for a Patriot system and other E.U. nations will contribute other key parts and munitions.\n\n\u201cUkraine is also fighting Europe's fight,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Zelenskyy was to visit Belgium and Spain earlier this month but postponed all his foreign trips after Russia launched its Kharkiv offensive and left Ukrainian forces reeling.\n\nIn other developments, the U.N.'s atomic agency\u2019s chief was in Russia's westernmost territory of Kaliningrad to talk about safety issues involving the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine.\n\nThe plant has been occupied by the Russian forces since early in the war, and all of its reactors have been in a cold shutdown. Frequent shelling around Europe's largest nuclear plant has raised global concerns over nuclear security.\n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Rafael Grossi met with Alexei Likhachyov, head of Russia\u2019s state nuclear energy corporation Rosatom. The Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Mr. Grossi as saying that \u201ccommon understanding\u201d has been reached on the steps that are necessary to enhance the plant\u2019s security, but restarting it \u201cseems impossible\u201d at the moment.\n\nMr. Likhachyov echoed his sentiment on restarting the plant, but also vowed its current state is \u201cabsolutely safe.\u201d",

            "text": "The Euclid space telescope has discovered seven more rogue planets, shining a light on the dark and lonely worlds floating freely through the universe untethered to any star.\n\nWithout being bound to a star, as the Earth is to the Sun, there are no days or years on these planets, which languish in perpetual night.\n\nYet scientists believe there is a chance they could be able to host life -- and estimate there may be trillions dotted throughout the Milky Way.\n\nLast week the European Space Agency released the Euclid telescope's first scientific results since the mission launched in July.\n\nAmong the discoveries were seven new free-floating planets, gas giants at least four times the mass of Jupiter.\n\nThey were spotted in the Orion Nebula, the nearest star-forming region to Earth, roughly 1,500 light years away.\n\nEuclid also confirmed the existence of dozens of other previously detected rogue planets.\n\nSpanish astronomer Eduardo Martin, the lead author of a pre-print study published on arXiv.org Friday, said this was likely just the \"tip of the iceberg\".\n\nBecause they do not reflect the light of a star, spotting rogue planets is like \"finding a needle in a haystack\", Martin told AFP.\n\nYounger planets, such as those discovered by Euclid, are hotter, making them a little easier to see.\n\nAwe and mystery\n\nSome research has suggested there are around 20 rogue planets for every star, which could put their number in the trillions in our home galaxy alone.\n\nGiven there are thought to be hundreds of billions of galaxies across the universe, the potential number of free-floating worlds becomes difficult to fathom.\n\nWhen NASA's Roman space telescope launches in 2027 it is expected find many more rogue planets, possibly offering clarity about how many could be out there.\n\nGavin Coleman, an astronomer at the Queen Mary University of London who was not involved in the Euclid research, said these strange worlds often evoked \"feelings of awe and mystery\".\n\n\"We've all grown up with the Sun in the sky, and so to think of a planet just drifting throughout space with no star on their horizon is fascinating,\" he told AFP.\n\nBut not all rogue planets wander alone. Four of the more than 20 confirmed by Euclid are believed to be binaries -- two planets orbiting each other in a single system.\n\nCould they host life?\n\nIf rogue planets are habitable, they could be a key target in humanity's search for extraterrestrial life.\n\n\"Some of our closest neighbours are likely rogue planets,\" Martin said.\n\nLacking heat from a nearby star, free-floating planets are believed to be cold, with frozen surfaces.\n\nThat means any life-supporting energy would have to come from inside the planet.\n\nMost of Neptune's energy comes from within, Coleman pointed out.\n\nAnd geothermal vents allow animals to survive on Earth that have never seen the Sun's rays.\n\nBut even under the best conditions, this extreme isolation would likely be able to support only bacterial and microbial life, Coleman said.\n\nAdvantage of being alone\n\nRogue planets could be thought of as traversing a lonely path through the cosmos.\n\nBut \"being around a star has its downsides\", said study co-author Christopher Conselice, professor of extragalactic astronomy at the UK's University of Manchester.\n\nOne particular downside comes to mind.\n\nOnce the Sun becomes a red giant -- in an estimated 7.6 billion years -- it will greatly expand, swallowing the Earth.\n\nRogue planets do not have to worry about eventually being destroyed by a star. \"These things will last forever,\" Conselice told AFP.\n\n\"If you don't mind the cold temperatures you could survive on these planets for eternity.\"\n\nThe Euclid study also offered clues to how rogue planets are created, Conselice said.\n\nSome could be formed in the outer part of a solar system before getting detached from their star and floating away.\n\nBut the study indicates that many rogue planets may be created as a \"natural byproduct\" of the star-formation process, he said.\n\nThis suggests a \"really close connection between stars and planets and how they form\", he said.\n\n\"There's no firm answers yet,\" he added.",

            "publish_date": "2024-05-29",
            "text": "Venus appears to be more volcanically active than previously known, according to scientists whose new analysis of decades-old radar images has spotted evidence of eruptions at two additional sites on the surface of Earth\u2019s inhospitable planetary neighbour.\n\nRadar images obtained by NASA's Magellan spacecraft from 1990 to 1992 indicated large lava flows at these two locations in the Venusian northern hemisphere at the time of the observations, the researchers said. These findings, coupled with previous studies, indicate that the planet's volcanic activity is comparable to Earth's, they added.\n\nMagellan mapped 98% of the Venusian surface. Advances in computing capability have made analyzing Magellan's radar data easier in recent years.\n\n\"These findings significantly change our understanding of the degree to which Venus is volcanically active, suggesting it could be much more active than previously thought,\" said planetary scientist Davide Sulcanese of d'Annunzio University in Pescara, Italy, lead author of the study published this week in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nOne of the two sites is a volcano called Sif Mons, which is about 200 miles (300 km) wide and situated in a region called Eistla Regio. The before-and-after radar images indicate a lava flow amounting to about 12 square miles (30 square km) of rock. The other site is a large volcanic plain in a region called Niobe Planitia. About 17 square miles (45 square kilometers) of rock was produced in this lava flow.\n\n\"Both Sif Mons and the volcanoes in Niobe Planitia are shield volcanoes, characterized by broad, gentle slopes formed by low-viscosity lava flows,\" said d'Annunzio University planetary scientist and study co-author Giuseppe Mitri.\n\nThe new rock at both locations was estimated to have an average depth between about 10 and 66 feet (three and 20 meters).\n\n\"The lava flows observed along the western flank of Sif Mons exhibit linear features with sinuous patterns that follow the direction of the maximum slope, generally towards the west,\" said planetary scientist and study co-author Marco Mastrogiuseppe of University Sapienza in Rome and Link Campus University in Rome.\n\n\"Regarding the flows in Niobe Planitia, the lava flows appear to originate near small shield volcanoes and extend towards the northeast, also following the direction of the slope,\" Mastrogiuseppe added.\n\nVenus is the second planet from the sun, and Earth the third. Venus has a diameter of about 7,500 miles (12,000 km), slightly smaller than Earth.\n\nThe new study builds on previous findings of ongoing Venusian volcanic activity. A 2023 study found that a volcanic vent on Maat Mons in a region called Atla Regio, near the equator, expanded and changed shape during the Magellan mission.\n\n\"Our study is the first to provide direct proof of lava flows formed during the Magellan mission period. By analyzing radar images from the Magellan spacecraft, we observed changes in surface morphology and radar data indicative of new lava flows,\" Sulcanese said.\n\n\"This offers direct evidence of ongoing volcanic activity on Venus, building upon previous evidence such as atmospheric sulfur dioxide variations, surface thermal emissions data, and especially the evidence of deformation of a volcanic vent observed in Atla Regio,\" Sulcanese said.\n\nStudying volcanic activity provides a fuller understanding of a planet's internal heat and geological processes.\n\n\"It provides insights into the planet's thermal evolution, surface renewal processes and atmospheric interactions,\" Mitri said.\n\nThe thick Venusian atmosphere, mainly carbon dioxide, traps in heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making Venus our solar system's hottest planet.\n\n\"Despite Venus and Earth being very similar in terms of size, mass, chemical composition and internal structure, there are fundamental differences that make Venus an infernal planet,\" with a roasting surface temperature and crushing atmospheric pressure, Sulcanese said.\n\n\"The reason for this different evolution is still a subject of debate,\" Sulcanese added, noting that planned NASA and European Space Agency missions in the coming years \"will help us better understand why these two planets have met such different fates.\"",

The risk of AI models giving incorrect personal data about individuals must also be addressed, the Irish officials said.\n\n\"There has been extensive engagement\" from leading U.S. tech firms including Google, Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn and OpenAI, said Dale Sunderland, one of the Irish regulator's two Data Protection Commissioners.\n\n\"They're seeking our views on some of their new products in the AI space, particularly the large language model space.\"\n\nGoogle agreed to delay and make changes to its Gemini AI chatbot following consultations with the Irish regulator, he said.\n\nWhile Ireland is the lead regulator for most of the top U.S. internet firms due to the location of their EU head offices in the country, other regulators can have a say in decisions via the European Data Protection Board, which is currently working on guidance on how AI should operate under EU data protection law, he said.\n\nAI model operators from next month will have to comply with the EU's landmark new AI Act. But they will also have to comply with the bloc's key data protection law, the General Data Protection Regulation, which can impose fines of up to 4% of a firm's total global turnover.\n\n\"The power of national regulators, including us, is quite broad,\" said Des Hogan, Ireland's other Data Protection Commissioner and chair of the commission.\n\n\"If they haven't done proper due diligence around the impacts of new products or services ... they run that risk of having to change the design downstream.\"",

            "publish_date": "2024-05-29",
            "text": "The growing shadow fleet of tankers transporting sanctioned Iranian, Venezuelan and Russian oil is filling up with the cheapest fuel available, hindering industry efforts to use cleaner fuel to cut shipping emissions, according to shipping data and sources.\n\nThe global shipping industry is under increasing pressure to use cleaner fuel to reduce both carbon and sulphur dioxide emissions and other pollutants and meet broader green targets.\n\nHundreds of tankers that are transporting sanctioned oil are posing a challenge since they are hard to track because of their opaque ownership and use of non-Western insurance and other marine services, and they have little incentive to follow cleaner shipping standards.\n\n\"You're seeing greater numbers of ships that have found ways to circumvent sanctions by operating outside Western jurisdiction,\" said Michelle Wiese Bockmann, principal analyst with maritime data group Lloyd's List Intelligence.\n\n\"The dark fleet has gone on steroids. And the deceptive shipping practices that they're engaging in are getting more and more complex and sophisticated.\"\n\nThose include dangerous ship-to-ship transfers of oil in international waters to avoid port state control scrutiny, falsifying ship identification numbers, tankers sending false information about their position, and the use of flag registries with lower standards of technical oversight and expertise, Bockmann said.\n\nLloyd's List Intelligence estimates the shadow fleet had grown to around 630 tankers from 530 a year ago, to make up 14.5% of the overall global tanker fleet.\n\nSome industry estimates put the number even higher, at over 800 tankers.\n\nThe numbers mark further rapid expansion following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and Western curbs on Russian energy exports, which has led to ships being hit with sanctions.\n\nBefore the war, the shadow tanker fleet totalled around 280-300 vessels, according to Lloyd's List Intelligence.\n\nSuch growth has raised concerns about its environmental impact as well as safety and the effectiveness of sanctions, including a Western ban on shipment and trading of Russian oil priced above a $60 per barrel limit.\n\nUnder the so-called IMO 2020 convention adopted by the United Nations' International Maritime Organization (IMO), ships have to switch to low sulphur fuel from the higher sulphur fuel diesel the industry has used for decades.\n\nNo \u2018scrubbers\u2019\n\nEnforcement of these regulations designed to lower emissions is up to IMO member countries, which can levy fines or detain ships for non-compliance. In April, the IMO called on its members to increase inspections on vessels deemed to be shadow ships and toughen fines for any irregularities.\n\nThe IMO rules say ships can only burn high sulphur fuel if they have exhaust gas cleaning systems, known as scrubbers.\n\nShadow fleet tankers, however, can run on higher sulphur diesel - that is estimated to cost 20% less than the greener fuel - without checks unless they are stopped at ports enforcing the regulations, people familiar with the matter said.\n\n\"A lot of shadow vessels have no scrubbers but they buy high sulphur fuel oil when they are in Russia,\" one industry source said. \"So, they are breaching the IMO's sulphur limit.\"\n\nIt is difficult to gauge the extent of non-compliance with IMO 2020 across the shadow fleet, but there has been a rise in cases of ships detained because of sulphur-related breaches.\n\nPort authorities in Europe and Asia detained at least 10 ships in the first five months of 2024 in connection with the convention, up from six in the same period last year and five for the whole of 2022, according to Reuters analysis based on data from port enforcement authorities. Of the 10 tankers detained, nine had made previous calls to Russia.\n\nRussian, Iranian fuel supplies\n\nRussia and its partners in the Eurasian Economic Union, which includes Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Belarus agreed in December they would continue using high sulphur fuel until the end of 2026.\n\nThis means that ships can still get high sulphur fuel at ports servicing those countries, people involved in the fuel shipping trade say.\n\nIran, another producer of high sulphur fuel, has supplied ships in the Middle East Gulf, the sources say.\n\nIn one such operation, the Casinova tanker loaded such fuel at Iran\u2019s Bandar Imam Khomeini port in recent months, said Claire Jungman, chief of staff at U.S. advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran, which tracks Iran-related tanker traffic via satellite data. The Casinova later transferred some of the fuel onto smaller ships waiting around the Basra Anchorage in southern Iraq, Jungman said.\n\nThe vessel's Liberia based owner Le Monde Marine Services could not be reached for comment.\n\nCasinova's ship insurer West P&I said it was in the process of cancelling the vessel's coverage after Reuters requested comment.\n\nShip certifier ABS, which has provided safety cover for the Casinova, was investigating its activity, a spokesperson for the U.S.-headquartered company said.\n\n\"ABS treats every allegation and the subject of sanctions very seriously,\" the spokesperson said. \"We remain committed to compliance with U.S. and UN sanctions regimes and all other applicable laws.\"",

            "text": "Bangladeshi weather experts said on May 28 that a deadly cyclone that carved a swath of destruction was one of the quickest-forming and longest-lasting they'd experienced, blaming climate change for the shift.\n\nCyclone Remal, which made landfall in low-lying Bangladesh and neighbouring India on May 26 evening with fierce gales and crashing waves, left at least 38 people dead, destroyed thousands of homes, smashed seawalls and flooded cities across the two countries.\n\nThe toll includes 12 workers who died on May 28 when a quarry collapsed in India's Mizoram state, which the government attributed to torrential rains as the storm progressed inland.\n\n\"In terms of its land duration, it is one of the longest in the country's history,\" Azizur Rahman, director of the state-run Bangladesh Meteorological Department told AFP, adding it had battered the country for more than 36 hours.\n\nIn contrast, Cyclone Aila, which hammered Bangladesh in 2009, lasted around 34 hours.\n\nCyclones have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh in recent decades, and the number of superstorms hitting its densely populated coast has increased sharply, from one a year to as many as three, due to the impact of climate change.\n\nSlow-moving and longer-lasting storms bring greater destruction.\n\n\"I've seen many storms in my life but nothing like this cyclone\", said Asma Khatun, an 80-year-old widow who lives with her son, a fisherman in Bangladesh's hard-hit coastal town of Patuakhali.\n\n\"Before, the storm came and went away... now it doesn't seem to go away. The incessant pouring and heavy wind kept us stuck for days\".\n\n'Impact of climate change'\n\nMr. Rahman said the cyclone triggered massive rains, with some cities receiving at least 200 millimetres (7.9 inches).\n\nStorm surges breached multiple embankments, meaning seawater flooded into farmland, damaged freshwater fish farms common along the coast, or corrupted drinking water.\n\nBangladesh's state minister for disaster Mohibbur Rahman said 3.75 million people had been affected by the cyclone, more than 35,000 homes were destroyed, and another 115,000 damaged.\n\n\"We don't know where to go,\" said Setara Begum, 75, surveying the wreckage of her home after its tin roof was ripped off.\n\nMeteorologist Mr. Rahman said the cyclone formed more quickly than almost all the cyclones they have monitored in recent decades.\n\n\"Of course, quick cyclone formation and the long duration of cyclones are due to the impact of climate change,\" Mr. Rahman said.\n\n\"It took three days for it to turn into a severe cyclone from low pressure in the Bay of Bengal... I've never seen a cyclone formed from a low pressure in such a quick time,\" he said.\n\n\"Usually, a cyclone is formed in the south and southwest of the Bay of Bengal, then takes seven to eight days to turn into a severe cyclone.\"\n\nDrowned, electrocuted, crushed\n\nBut while scientists say climate change is fuelling more storms, better forecasting and more effective evacuation planning have dramatically reduced death tolls.\n\nAround a million people in Bangladesh and neighbouring India fled inland seeking safety \u2014 but many people preferred to stay put to guard their homes.\n\nIn Bangladesh, Cyclone Remal killed at least 17 people, according to the disaster management office and police, who reported on May 28 the additional deaths of a husband and wife, \"crushed under stacks of bricks\" when their house collapsed.\n\nSome drowned. Others were killed by debris, falling trees or electrocuted by falling power lines.\n\nThousands of electricity poles were torn down, and power is out across large areas, said Biswanath Sikder, chief engineer of the Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board.\n\n\"More than 20 million people are without electricity,\" Mr. Sikder told AFP.\n\nIn India, 21 people died, according to the latest tolls on May 28, including eight in West Bengal, one in Assam, as well as 12 quarry workers killed in Mizoram.\n\nBut the worst impact was stemmed by the expansive Sundarbans mangrove forest straddling Bangladesh and India \u2014 where the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers meet the sea, Bangladesh's state weather department said.\n\nThe crucial sea-water coastal forests help dissipate the violence of such storms.\n\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) warned this month that half of the world's mangrove ecosystems are at risk of collapse due to climate change, deforestation and pollution.",

Purushothaman said, construction activities were being carried on to establish an electric crematorium at the same location with a capacity to cremate 14 bodies a day.\n\nFurther, claiming there was absolutely no necessity to establish the crematorium since enough number of them were in existence in the taluk, the counsel said, the foundation was attempting to create an impression as if the crematorium was being established only at the request of the villagers.\n\nHe feared the petitioner and his family would be put to great hardship if the crematorium was allowed to be constructed close to his property and sought a direction to the Coimbatore Collector to conduct an inquiry as how the Ikkarai Boluvampatti panchayat president had granted approval for the construction.",

Vasan on Wednesday, May 29, 2024.\n\nEvery year, to facilitate farmers of Cauvery delta districts in irrigating the short-term paddy crop during the kuruvai season, the Tamil Nadu government opens the Mettur dam on June 12, the customary date. However, this year the chances of opening the dam on the usual date seem unlikely due to the unavailability of an adequate quantum of water in the reservoir. This situation is likely to reduce the extent of kuruvai paddy cultivation in the delta districts, Mr. Vasan said in a statement.\n\nFarmers in several parts of the delta districts have started cultivation, hoping to utilise groundwater and water from water bodies such as lakes and ponds for irrigating the paddy crop using motor pumps. Considering this situation, the State government should ensure uninterrupted power supply for at least 18 hours a day and extend the loans for farmers through agriculture cooperative societies. The Agriculture Department should also start disbursing special package for kuruvai season to farmers without any delay, he added.",

The owner of the land, on whose property the open well was located, had informed the forest department about the presence of a herd of elephants, comprising the calf and at least three others when he heard the sounds of the animals in distress.\n\nThe herd refused to leave the side of the calf and had to be chased away by forest department staff to ensure the safety of the team of rescuers.\n\nThe forest department used two earth excavators to dig a route into the well, expanding the escape route and also making a ramp for the elephant calf to walk up. Following the operation, the elephant calf was rescued by the forest department, who had deputed over 70 personnel to assist in the rescue operations.\n\nThey had also posted teams to keep tabs on the rest of the herd, so that the calf could be quickly reunited following the rescue. District Forest Officer, D. Vengatesh Prabhu oversaw the entire operation.\n\nAfter the calf was extricated from the well, it was assessed for injuries by the forest department. It was then allowed to rejoin its herd.\n\nSupriya Sahu, Additional Chief Secretary, Environment, Climate Change and Forests to the government of Tamil Nadu, put out a tweet on \u2018X\u2019 (formerly known as Twitter) stating, \u201cA very heartening news is coming in just now about the successful rescue and reunion of a juvenile elephant in Tamil Nadu...

            "publish_date": "2024-05-29",
            "text": "Donald Trump engaged in a conspiracy \u201cto hoodwink voters\u201d in 2016, a prosecutor told jurors on May 28 during closing arguments in the former President\u2019s hush money trial, while a defence lawyer branded the star witness as the \u201cgreatest liar of all time\u201d and pressed the panel for an across-the-board acquittal.\n\nThe lawyers' duelling accounts, wildly divergent in their assessments of witness credibility, Mr. Trump's culpability and the strength of evidence offered both sides one final chance to score points with the jury before it started deliberating the first felony case against a former American President.\n\nThe landmark case, the only one of four criminal prosecutions against Mr. Trump to reach trial, centred on allegations that Mr. Trump and his allies conspired to stifle potentially embarrassing stories during the 2016 presidential campaign through hush money payments \u2014 including to a porn actor who alleged that she and Mr. Trump had sex a decade earlier.\n\n\u201cThis case, at its core, is about a conspiracy and a cover-up,\u201d prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told jurors, who are expected to begin deliberations on May 29. He later added: \u201cWe\u2019ll never know if this effort to hoodwink voters made the difference in the 2016 election, but that\u2019s not something we have to prove.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors that neither the actor, Stormy Daniels, nor the Trump attorney who paid her, Michael Cohen, can be trusted.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" Mr. Blanche said.\n\nFollowing more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee ahead of the November election. The political undertones of the proceedings were unmistakable as President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign staged an event outside the courthouse with actor Robert De Niro while Mr. Blanche reminded jurors the case was not a referendum on their views about Mr. Trump.\n\nIn a marathon five-hour argument that stretched deep into the evening, Mr. Steinglass stressed to jurors the trove of evidence they had viewed but also sought to defray potential concerns about witness credibility. Mr. Trump and his legal team, for instance, have repeatedly denounced Mr. Cohen as a liar.\n\nThe prosecutor acknowledged that Ms. Daniels' account of the alleged 2006 encounter in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite, which Mr. Trump has denied, was at times \u201ccringeworthy.\u201d But he said the details she offered \u2014 including about decor and what she said she saw when she snooped in Trump\u2019s toiletry kit \u2014 were full of touchstones \u201cthat kind of ring true.\u201d\n\nHe said the story matters because it \u201creinforces (Mr. Trump's) incentive to buy her silence.\"\n\n\u201cHer story is messy. It makes people uncomfortable to hear. It probably makes some of you uncomfortable to hear. But that\u2019s kind of the point,\u201d Mr. Steinglass said. He added: \u201cIn the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive.\u201d\n\nThe payoff unfolded against the backdrop of the disclosure of a 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\" recording in which Mr. Trump could be heard bragging about grabbing women sexually without their permission. Had the Daniels story emerged after that recording, it would have undermined his strategy of spinning away his words, Mr. Steinglass said.\n\n\"It\u2019s critical to appreciate this,\u201d Mr. Steinglass said. At the same time he was dismissing his words on the tape as \u201clocker room talk,\u201d Trump \u201cwas negotiating to muzzle a porn star,\u201d the prosecutor said.\n\nMr. Blanche, who spoke first, sought to downplay the fallout by saying the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was not a \u201cdoomsday event.\u201d\n\nMr. Steinglass also maintained that the prosecution's case did not rest solely on Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet. Mr. Cohen later pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments, as well as to lying to Congress. He went to prison and was disbarred, but his direct involvement in the transactions made him a key trial witness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about whether you like Michael Cohen. It\u2019s not about whether you want to go into business with Michael Cohen,\" Mr. Steinglass said. \u201cIt\u2019s whether he has useful, reliable information to give you about what went down in this case, and the truth is that he was in the best position to know.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe two sides also differed on a recording Mr. Cohen made of himself and Mr. Trump discussing what prosecutors say was a plan to buy the rights to the story of a Playboy model, Karen McDougal, from the National Enquirer, after the publication's parent company paid her $150,000 to keep quiet about an affair she says she had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has denied that affair too.\n\nMr. Blanche said the September 2016 recording, which cuts off before the conversation finishes, is unreliable and isn\u2019t about Ms. McDougal at all, but rather about a plan to buy a collection of the material the tabloid had hoarded on Mr. Trump. Mr. Steinglass said the recording was part of a \u201cmountain of evidence\u201d against Mr. Trump.\n\nThough the case featured sometimes seamy discussion of sex and tabloid industry practices, the actual charges concern something decidedly less flashy: reimbursements Mr. Trump signed for Mr. Cohen for the payments.\n\nThe reimbursements were recorded as being for legal expenses, which prosecutors say was a fraudulent label designed to conceal the purpose of the hush money transaction.\n\nDefense lawyers say Mr. Cohen actually did substantive legal work for Mr. Trump and his family. But Mr. Steinglass said that argument is undermined by a 2018 Trump tweet in which the then-president described the arrangement with Mr. Cohen as a \u201creimbursement\u201d while insisting it was unrelated to his candidacy.\n\n\"Mr. Cohen spent more time being cross-examined at this trial than he did doing legal work for Donald Trump in 2017,\u201d Mr. Steinglass quipped. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s any chance Donald Trump would pay $42,000 an hour for legal work by Michael Cohen?\u201d\n\nIn his own address to the jury, Mr. Blanche castigated the case's entire foundation.\n\nHe said Mr. Cohen, not Mr. Trump, created the invoices submitted to the Trump Organization for reimbursement, and he rejected the prosecution's caricature of a details-oriented manager, suggesting instead that Trump was preoccupied with the presidency and not the checks he was signing. And he mocked the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to election interference.\n\n\u201cEvery campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,\u201d Mr. Blanche said.\n\nHe reserved his most animated attack for Mr. Cohen, with whom he tangled during a lengthy cross-examination.\n\nMimicking the term \u201cGOAT,\u201d used primarily in sports as an acronym for \u201cgreatest of all time,\u201d Mr. Blanche labelled Mr. Cohen the \u201cGLOAT\" \u2014 greatest liar of all time \u2014 and called him \u201cthe human embodiment of reasonable doubt.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him. His financial and personal well-being depends on this case. He is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true,\u201d Mr. Blanche said, a reference to Mr. Cohen's social media attacks on Mr. Trump and the lucrative income he has derived from books and podcasts about Mr. Trump.\n\nThe attorney's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Mr. Blanche sought to unravel Mr. Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Mr. Trump by phone about the Ms. Daniels arrangement on Oct. 24, 2016.\n\nMr. Cohen testified that he had contacted Mr. Trump's bodyguard, Keith Schiller, as a way of getting a hold of Trump, but Mr. Blanche asserted that at the time Mr. Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied with that problem when he spoke with Mr. Schiller.\n\n\u201cThat was a lie,\u201d Mr. Blanche said, \"and he got caught red-handed.\u201d\n\nIn his testimony, Mr. Cohen acknowledged a litany of past lies, many of which he said were intended to protect Trump. But he said he had subsequently told the truth, at great cost: \u201cMy entire life has been turned upside-down as a direct result,\u201d he said.",

The miner said its operations were not affected.\n\nMr. Marape said the government was working with Mr. Barrick to reopen the road. Mr. Barrick said it had offered the government more heavy equipment at the slip site.\n\nThe United Nations, in its latest update, said a bridge had collapsed on Tuesday on the main road toward the disaster area, potentially delaying rescue teams reaching the site.\n\nThe U.N. migration agency has warned of an outbreak of infectious diseases if immediate steps are not taken.\n\n\"Every passing minute, bodies buried under the debris are decaying, with water squeezed between the ground and the vast debris covering an area of three to four football fields is continuing to leak, this is posing a high health risk,\" Serhan Aktoprak, the chief of the agency's mission in Papua New Guinea said in an emailed statement.",

Prajwal Revanna had it all.

Just last week, HD Deve Gowda also gave a stern warning to Prajwal to return home and face the law or suffer the family\u2019s ire. But, at the same time, the Gowda family has also defended HD Revanna, calling the abduction case against him a political ploy to tarnish the family\u2019s reputation, and more importantly making the leaking of video clips through pen drives the focus of their argument.\n\nYes, the distribution of the videos without masking the identity of the survivors is a despicable, indefensible crime and it must be investigated. But we cannot, and must not, let ourselves be distracted from what this case really is - the sexual assault and abuse of scores of helpless women by a man in a position of power.\n\nWill Prajwal Revanna keep his word?
