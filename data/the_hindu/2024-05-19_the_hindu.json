            "publish_date": "2024-05-19",
            "text": "The Congress on May 19 claimed that the Modi Government's Forest Conservation Amendment Act had \"undid\" the progress of the historic Forest Rights Act of 2006 and accused the BJP of diluting tribal rights.\n\nCongress general secretary Jairam Ramesh posed questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of his rally in Jharkhand's Jamshedpur.\n\n\"Why do the people of Jamshedpur still suffer from poor connectivity? Why is it that the 2As and their tempo-loads of black money roam free, while Jharkhand's Adivasi CM was put in jail? Why is the Adityapur Industrial Area still waiting for environmental clearance? Why has the PM denied Adivasis their religious identity and refused to recognise the Sarna code?\" Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nElaborating on what he said were \"jumla details\", he said Jamshedpur, despite being an industrial hub, has poor transport connectivity.\n\nThe number of trains running to key cities such as Bhagalpur, Bengaluru, and Delhi are inadequate, he said.\n\nThe city had a functional airport until 2016 but despite being inducted into the UDAN scheme in 2018, plans for a new airport have failed to materialise, Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nIn January 2019, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Jharkhand Government and the Airports Authority of India for the construction of Dhalbhumgarh Airport by December 2022, he said.\n\n\"This would have been a massive boost to the industrial sector, from major players like Tata to the MSME sector in Adityapur. When the December 2022 deadline came and went, BJP's own MPs were compelled to raise the issue in Parliament. On February 27, 2023, the Union Civil Aviation Minister responded and confirmed that the project had been abandoned,\" Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nNow, after much hassle, environmental permission seems to have been granted, he said.\n\nWhy has the Modi Government neglected such essential infrastructure in Jharkhand, Mr. Ramesh asked.\n\n\"What happened to 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas'?\" he said.\n\n\"The outgoing PM's two best friends have been safe from the ED and CBI despite their tempos full of black money but Jharkhand's Adivasi Chief Minister was shamelessly thrown into jail. This is hardly surprising given how the Bhrasht Janata Party has sought to undermine Adivasi identity and dilute Adivasi rights,\" Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nLast year, the Modi Government passed the Forest Conservation Amendment Act which undid the progress of the historic Forest Rights Act of 2006 and scrapped provisions for the consent of local communities and other statutory requirements for forest clearance in vast areas, he said.\n\n\"The intention, of course, is to hand over access to the Prime Minister's best friends. Will the PM ever stop paying lip service to the slogan of Jal-Jangal-Zameen and meaningfully commit himself to Adivasi welfare?\" the Congress leader said.\n\n\u201cCan he shed some light on why the ED and CBI are yet to investigate his best friends\u2019 tempos?\u201d Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nHe further said that more than half of Jamshedpur's vital industrial hub \u2014 the Adityapur Industrial Area \u2014 has remained in regulatory limbo since 2015.\n\n\"This Special Economic Zone (SEZ) is home to 1,200 units, including 11 large-scale, 64 small-scale, and 166 tiny industries. In 2015, the Jharkhand State Industry Department provided clarifications regarding 54 acres of forest land within the 276-acre Special Economic Zone (SEZ) at the Adityapur Industrial Zone,\" Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nHowever, the Modi Government's delay in granting forest and environmental clearances have hindered development, he claimed.\n\n\"While this project has languished, the Modi Sarkar, in 2019, approved a Rs 14,000 crore SEZ project for Adani Power in Godda. Why is it that the Adityapur Industrial Area has waited almost 10 years, while Adani projects have been quickly pushed through? Was it during this deal that the outgoing PM saw the tempo-loads of black money that he told us about?\" Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nHe said for years, Jharkhand's tribal communities, followers of the Sarna faith, have sought official recognition of their distinct religious identity in India.\n\n\"However, the recent decision to remove the 'Others' option from the religion column in the census poses a dilemma for Sarna adherents, who must now choose between leaving the column blank or aligning themselves with specified religions,\" Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nIn November 2020, the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly passed a resolution endorsing this demand, he pointed out.\n\n\"Despite former BJP Chief Minister Raghubar Das's assurance of enacting the Sarna Code by 2021, and Home Minister Amit Shah promising the same in 2019, no progress has been made by the Modi Sarkar. As Prime Minister Modi visits Jharkhand, will he address this issue and clarify where he stands on enacting the Sarna Code? Were the promises made by Raghubar Das and Amit Shah mere jumlas?\" Mr. Ramesh said and asked the Prime Minister to break his \"silence\" on these issues.",

According to statistics released by the Union Ministry of Coal for 2022-23, Tamil Nadu accounted for 49.97% of the production, followed by Gujarat at 27.37% ,and Rajasthan at 22.67%.\n\nNLC India Ltd., headquartered at Neyveli in Tamil Nadu, contributes a lion\u2019s share of lignite production. The public sector undertaking (PSU) lists, as among its performance highlights, the all-time high coal and lignite production of 36.32 tonnes in 2023-24 across the country.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu, the NLCIL\u2019s installed power generation capacity is 4,390 MW of thermal projects and 1,411 MW of renewable energy projects. Officials said some challenges in land acquisition had been overcome and that lignite production would be ramped up. However, much emphasis is also being laid on capacity addition through renewable energy sources.\n\n\u201cSustainability has been in all our actions, since inception,\u201d said Prasanna Kumar Motupalli, chairman and managing director, NLCIL. It was the first Central PSU to achieve 1 GW renewable energy capacity in India. The company has set as its target an installed capacity of 17.1 GW, including 6 GW renewable capacity, by 2030.\n\nThe environmental consequences of mining can be harsh. Green initiatives are being undertaken for the sustainable end use of land resources but more needs to be done on this aspect. At present, the focus is on scientific reclamation of mined lands. Going forward, there will be efforts to establish community-centric land uses such as restored forests and eco-parks, says the foreword to a report on \u201cGreening Initiatives in Coal and Lignite PSUs\u201d brought out by the Ministry of Coal.\n\nIn open cast mines, coal can be extracted only after removing layers of soil and stones. This soil and stone is known as overburden. This \u201coverburden\u201d is removed and treated for other uses in order to reduce the environmental impact of mining. Afforestation is another initiative that has been undertaken in some areas.\n\nDust to dust: Soil and stone removed from the lignite mine is piled high. It can be used to refill the mines after treatment to ensure sustainability.\n\nDigging deep: Layers of soil and stone, known as overburden, being removed in search of lignite deposits.\n\nDunes of waste: An overburden dumpsite where environment-friendly reclamation is being planned.\n\nNon-stop action: Specialised mining equipment excavating lignite.\n\nCoal hunt: Specialised mining equipment, the bucket wheel excavator, being operated at a coal mine in Neyveli.\n\nHunger pangs: Workers take a meal break at the work site.\n\nEfficient route: Lignite is loaded on a long-distance curved conveyor belt, to avoid vehicular transport inside the mine.\n\nReady to go: A transport system eases the carriage of lignite to the thermal plant for power generation.\n\nLate shift: A view of the mine at night.",

            "text": "Southwest monsoon, the lifeline of India's farm-based economy, on Sunday made its onset over the Nicobar Islands, the southernmost region of the country, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said here.\n\n\"Southwest monsoon has advanced into some parts of the Maldives, and the Comorin area and some parts of the South Bay of Bengal, Nicobar Islands and South Andaman Sea on Sunday,\" the weather office said.\n\nThe annual rainfall phenomenon is expected to reach Kerala by May 31.\n\nThe date of monsoon onset over Kerala has varied widely over the last 150 years, the earliest being May 11 in 1918, and the most delayed being June 18 in 1972, according to IMD data.\n\nThe rain-bearing system arrived in the southern state on June 8 last year, May 29 in 2022, June 3 in 2021 and June 1 in 2020.\n\nLast month, the IMD had forecast above-normal rain in the monsoon season in India with favourable La Nina conditions, cooling of equatorial Pacific Ocean, expected to set in by August-September. La Nina conditions help in a good monsoon season over India.\n\nLarge parts of the country are battling a brutal heatwave with maximum temperatures touching 48 degrees Celsius, shattering records in several states and severely impacting health and livelihoods. Southern India experienced heatwave spells in April.\n\nThe crippling heat is straining power grids and drying up water bodies triggering drought-like conditions in parts of the country. A prediction of above-normal monsoonal rainfall, therefore, comes as a huge relief to the fast-developing South Asian nation.\n\nThe monsoon is critical for India's agricultural landscape, with 52% of the net cultivated area relying on it. It is also crucial for replenishing reservoirs critical for drinking water, apart from power generation across the country.\n\nJune and July are considered the most important monsoon months for agriculture because most of the sowing for the kharif crop takes place during this period.",

Ltd., (ABSLI) has drawn up a multi-pronged strategy to double its business over the next three years using unconventional route and innovative products, said its MD & CEO Kamlesh Rao.\n\n\u201cWe have drawn up plans to double our revenues from all streams by FY27 using unconventional route and innovative products,\u201d he said in an interaction.\n\nThe plan calls for doubling the individual first year premium from \u20b93,000 crore to \u20b96,000 crore, group life insurance from \u20b94,000 crore to \u20b98,000 crore, value of new business margin from \u20b9700 crore to \u20b91,350 crore and gross written premium from \u20b917,500 crore to \u20b935,000 crore.\n\nAccording to him, ABSLI plans to achieve this target by focusing on new products, enhancing distribution channels, doubling manpower and creating new distribution agencies.\n\nTalking about the unconventional route, he said: \u201cOur initial focus is on two wheeler, four wheeler and commercial vehicles dealers, chemist, jewellers, travel agents and holiday partners, who are having a huge loyal customer base. At the dealerships, we have vehicle insurance agents, who have not sold life insurance in the past. We are targeting them.\u201d\n\nABSLI also did a pilot run with 65 partners in a tier-III town in Uttar Pradesh. Though, it tasted some success with car and two wheeler dealers, it was not so encouraging with chemists and jewellers. It is likely to try its hand with travel agents and resort owners soon.\n\n\u201cWhile some came forward to deploy their own staff for the new services, others sought our help in training. We will be looking at more agencies. In the first year, we expect to do a business of \u20b9150 crore,\u201d he said.\n\nAsserting that they are currently ranked fifth in group life insurance and seventh in individual life insurance, he said their target was to scale it up by two more notches respectively.\n\nMr. Rao said that they are focused on providing different set of products for different segment of people such as the income protection plan by June and a new savings product targeting women by August/September.",

Officials believe Stewart suffered a medical episode, according to CNN.\n\nIn an email to staff, the network's CEO Mark Thompson called Stewart \u201ca very dear friend and colleague to all of us at CNN.\u201d\n\n\u201cA political veteran and an Emmy Award-winning journalist who brought an incomparable spark to CNN's coverage, known across our bureaus not only for her political savvy, but for her unwavering kindness,\" he wrote. \"Our hearts are heavy as we mourn such an extraordinary loss.\u201d\n\nNo further information about the cause of death or survivors was available Saturday.\n\nStewart was born on March 11, 1966, in Atlanta, and began her career as a local reporter in Georgia before moving to Little Rock, Arkansas to be a news anchor. She went on to serve as the communications director in then-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's office. She assumed similar roles during Huckabee's presidential run in 2008 and served as communications director for the 2012 presidential bids of Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and then former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. Most recently, Stewart was the communications director for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cHeartbreaking,\" Mr. Cruz posted Saturday on X, formerly Twitter. \"Alice was wonderful and talented and a dear friend. And she loved America fiercely. She lived every day to the fullest, and she will be deeply missed. May God's comfort and peace be upon her loved ones.

She last appeared Friday on \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.\u201d Stewart told the Harvard Political Review in 2020 that she brings \u201ca perspective that I think CNN appreciates.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy position at CNN is to be a conservative voice yet an independent thinker,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI'm not a Kool-Aid drinker; I'm not a never-Trumper, and I didn't check my common sense and decency at the door when I voted for (Trump).\u201d\n\nFormer Arkansas governor and presidential candidate Asa Hutchinson posted on X that Stewart\u2019s \u201csudden death is such a loss to all who valued her friendship as well as her political passion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI first met Alice in Arkansas and I am proud that she focused on making friends in politics and not making enemies,\u201d he posted. \u201cThank you Alice Stewart!\u201d\n\nStewart also co-hosted the podcast \u201cHot Mics from Left to Right\u201d alongside fellow CNN commentator Maria Cardona and served on the senior advisory committee at the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School where she was previously a fellow.\n\nIn her free time, Stewart was an avid runner, according to CNN.

The Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) withdrew its support last week while quitting the coalition government.\n\nThis will be Prime Minister Prachanda's fourth vote of confidence within one and a half years after he assumed the top executive position on December 25, 2022.\n\nThe new government requires at least 138 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives to win the vote of trust.\n\nEarlier on March 13, Prime Minister Dahal won his third consecutive vote of confidence.\n\nLast year, Mr. Prachanda faced a floor test after former Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli-led CPN-UML withdrew its support to the Prachanda-led government following a rift over backing the main opposition party\u2019s candidate for the presidential poll.\n\nMr. Prachanda's support has notably declined in successive confidence votes. In January 2023, he obtained 268 votes, followed by 172 in March of the same year. His support further dwindled to just 157 votes in the third-floor test.\n\nCurrently, the ruling coalition holds a majority with 77 seats of the CPN-UML, 32 of the Maoist Centre, 21 of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, seven of the newly formed Janata Samajbadi Party and 10 seats of the CPN-Unified Socialist (CPN-US).\n\nMeanwhile, the major political parties have agreed to form a panel to look into the misappropriation of fund by cooperatives.",

            "text": "An Israeli airstrike killed 20 people in central Gaza, mostly women and children, and fighting raged across the north on Sunday as Israel's leaders aired divisions over who should govern Gaza after the war, now in its eighth month.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has faced criticism from his own War Cabinet, with his main political rival, Benny Gantz, threatening to leave the government if a plan is not formulated by June 8 that includes an international administration for postwar Gaza.\n\nExplained | How bad is the humanitarian crisis in Gaza?\n\nU.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan was expected to meet with top Israeli leaders on Sunday to discuss an ambitious U.S. plan for Saudi Arabia to recognise Israel and help the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza in exchange for a path to eventual statehood.\n\nMr. Netanyahu, who is opposed to Palestinian statehood, has rejected those proposals, saying Israel will maintain open-ended security control over Gaza and partner with local Palestinians unaffiliated with Hamas or the Western-backed Palestinian Authority.\n\nMr. Gantz' withdrawal would not bring down Mr. Netanyahu's coalition government, but it would leave him more reliant on far-right allies who support the \u201cvoluntary emigration\u201d of Palestinians from Gaza, full military occupation and the rebuilding of Jewish settlements there.\n\nEven as the discussions of postwar planning take on new weight, the war is still raging with no end in sight. In recent weeks, Hamas has regrouped in parts of northern Gaza that were heavily bombed in the early days of the war and where Israeli ground troops had already operated.\n\nThe airstrike in Nuseirat, a built-up Palestinian refugee camp in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, killed 20 people, including eight women and four children, according to records at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah, which received the bodies.\n\nA separate strike on a street in Nuseirat killed another five people, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent emergency service. In Deir al-Balah, a strike killed Zahed al-Houli, a senior officer in the Hamas-run police, and another man, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.\n\nPalestinians reported more airstrikes and heavy fighting in northern Gaza, which has been largely isolated by Israeli troops for months and where the World Food Programme says a famine is underway.\n\nThe Civil Defence says the strikes hit several homes near Kamal Adwan Hospital in the town of Beit Lahiya, killing at least 10 people. Footage released by the rescuers showed them trying to pull the body of a woman out of the rubble as explosions echo in the background and smoke rises.\n\nIn the urban Jabliya refugee camp nearby, residents reported a heavy wave of artillery and airstrikes.\n\nWatch | Israel\u2019s Rafah invasion | Explained\n\n\u201cThe situation is very difficult,\u201d said Abdel-Kareem Radwan, a 48-year-old in Jabaliya. He said the whole eastern side has become a battle zone where the Israeli fighter jets \u201cstrike anything that moves.\"\n\nMahmoud Bassal, a spokesman for the Civil Defence, said rescuers had recovered at least 150 bodies, more than half of them women and children, since Israel launched the operation in Jabaliya last week. He said around 300 homes have been \u201ccompletely destroyed.\u201d\n\nIsrael launched its offensive after Hamas' October 7 attack, in which Palestinian militants stormed into southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting some 250.\n\nThe war has killed at least 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Around 80% of the population of 2.3 million Palestinians have been displaced within the territory, often multiple times.\n\nIsrael says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames the high death toll and destruction on Hamas, which positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in dense, residential areas.\n\nMr. Netanyahu's critics, including thousands of protesters who took to the streets again on Saturday, accuse him of prolonging the war and rejecting a cease-fire deal that would release hostages so he can avoid a reckoning over the security failures that led to the attack.\n\nPolls show that Mr. Gantz, a political centrist, would likely succeed Mr. Netanyahu if early elections are held. That would expose Mr. Netanyahu to prosecution on longstanding corruption allegations.\n\nMr. Netanyahu denies any political motives and says the offensive must continue until Hamas is dismantled and the estimated 100 hostages held in Gaza, and the remains of more than 30 others, are returned.\n\nHe has said it's pointless to discuss postwar arrangements while Hamas is still fighting because the militants have threatened anyone who cooperates with Israel.\n\nNetanyahu also faces pressure from Israel's closest ally, the United States, which has provided crucial military aid and diplomatic cover for the offensive while expressing growing frustration with Israel's conduct of the war.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration recently held up a shipment of 3,500 bombs of up to 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms) each and said the U.S. would not provide offensive weapons for a full-scale invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah, citing fears of a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nBut last week, after Israel launched what it says is a limited operation in Rafah, the administration told legislators it would move forward with the sale of $1 billion worth of arms, tank ammunition, tactical vehicles and mortar rounds, according to congressional aides.\n\nMr. Sullivan is expected in Israel after meeting with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Saturday. The administration has been working on an ambitious plan in which Saudi Arabia would recognise Israel and join other Arab states in helping to administer and rebuild Gaza, in exchange for a U.S. defence pact and help in building a civilian nuclear programme.\n\nBut U.S. and Saudi officials say that deal requires Israel to agree to a credible path to eventual Palestinian statehood, something Mr. Netanyahu has repeatedly ruled out.\n\nIn Mr. Gantz' ultimatum, he expressed support for normalizing ties with Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries. But he also said \u201cwe will not allow any outside power, friendly or hostile, to impose a Palestinian state on us.\u201d",

            "text": "The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on May 20 a petition challenging the enactment of three new laws that seek to overhaul India's penal codes claiming that they suffer from many \"defects and discrepancies\".\n\nA vacation bench of Justices Bela M Trivedi and Pankaj Mithal is likely to hear the matter.\n\nThe Lok Sabha, on December 21 last year, passed three key legislations \u2014 the Bharatiya Nyaya (Second) Sanhita, the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha (Second) Sanhita and the Bharatiya Sakshya (Second) Bill. President Droupadi Murmu gave her assent to the bills on December 25.\n\nThese new laws \u2014 the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and the Bharatiya Sakshya Act \u2014 will replace the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and the Indian Evidence Act respectively.\n\nSeeking a stay on the operation of the three new laws, the PIL filed by advocate Vishal Tiwari has said they were enacted without any parliamentary debate as most of the opposition members were under suspension.\n\nThe plea has sought directions from the court for the immediately constitution of an expert committee that will assess the viability of the three new criminal laws.\n\n\"The new criminal laws are far more draconian and establish a police state in reality and violate every provision of fundamental rights of the people of India. If the British laws were considered colonial and draconian, then the Indian laws stand now far more draconian as, in the British period, you could keep a person in police custody for a maximum of 15 days. Extending 15 days to 90 days and more is a shocking provision enabling police torture,\" the plea has said.\n\nThe Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita encompasses offences, such as acts of secession, armed rebellion, subversive activities, separatist activities or endangering the sovereignty or unity of the country, in a new avatar of the sedition law.\n\nAccording to the new laws, anyone purposely or knowingly, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, by visible representation, by electronic communication, by use of financial means, or otherwise, excites or attempts to excite secession or an armed rebellion or subversive activities, or encourages feelings of separatist activities or endangers the sovereignty or unity and integrity of India or indulges in or commits any such act shall be punished with imprisonment for life or with imprisonment that may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.\n\nAccording to IPC section 124A, which deals with sedition, anyone involved in the crime may be punished with life imprisonment or with a three-year jail term. Under the new laws, \"Rajdroh\" has got a new term, \"Deshdroh\", doing away with the reference to the British crown. Loosely explained, \"Rajdroh\" refers to a rebellion or an act against the ruler, while \"Deshdroh\" represents such acts against the nation.\n\nAlso, for the first time, the word \"terrorism\" has been defined in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. It was absent in the IPC. Under the new laws, the magistrate's power to impose fines has been increased as well as the scope for declaring a proclaimed offender.",

In the coming time, our bank accounts will be frozen and we will be brought on the road since our office will also be taken away,\" he said.\n\n\"There will be bigger challenges ahead. Please be ready to face them. Remember one thing we faced many challenges in the past. We have the blessings of Lord Hanuman and God. We would have not survived these. Walk on the path of truth. We want to work for the society,\" he told them.\n\nMr. Kejriwal, who is out on interim bail in the excise policy case, had said on Saturday that he and other AAP leaders would go to the BJP headquarters on May 19 \"so that the Prime Minister can send anyone he wishes to jail\".\n\n\"We will peacefully march to the BJP headquarters and if the police stop us, we will sit at that spot. We will wait for half an hour and see if they arrest us. If they do not arrest us, it will be their defeat. You can send us all in jail and see for yourself if the party ends or it rises more,\" he said.\n\nRecalling the period he was lodged in the Tihar Jail, Mr. Kejriwal said he read the Bhagavad Gita twice and the Ramayana once.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)",

            "text": "The Election Commission of India has given permission for holding the meeting of the Telangana State Cabinet with certain conditions.\n\nThe ECI said, in a communication to the Chief Electoral Officer Vikas Raj, that only those matters which were of an emergency nature and were to be implemented in a time-bound schedule should be taken up during the Cabinet meeting. \u201cThe Cabinet may only take up matters which are emergent and urgent and can\u2019t wait up to June 4,\u201d ECI principal secretary Avinash Kumar said.\n\nAccordingly, the issue of the common capital of Hyderabad and crop loan waiver should be deferred till the completion of the Lok Sabha election 2024 in Telangana. In addition, the ECI directed that no State Government officer involved in the conduct of election should be called for the meeting.\n\nThe ECI\u2019s conditional permission has come as a setback to the State Government that planned to discuss the pending bifurcation issues with neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. The Cabinet was expected to take stock of the pending issues between the two States and the assurances given to Telangana in the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014.\n\nDiscussion about the modalities for implementing cop loan waiver up to \u20b92 lakh was another major item on the agenda of the Cabinet on Saturday which was however adjourned after the ECI did not respond to the State Government\u2019s letter (Dated May 16) seeking permission for holding the meeting of the State Council of Ministers.\n\nThe issue assumes significance as Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy was keen that the commitment made by Congress in the run-up to the elections was fulfilled by Aug 15, coinciding with Independence Day. The Government had directed the officials concerned to come up with a road map for the mobilisation of finances that would be required for fulfilling the assurance.",
