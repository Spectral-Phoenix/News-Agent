        "text": "The Madras High Court has directed Villupuram Collector to exhume the body of an individual suspected to have died due to custodial torture on April 10, and issued a consequential direction to the Director of Medical Education (DME) to make arrangements for performing a re-postmortem.\n\nJustice R. Sakthivel passed the orders on a writ petition filed by R. Anju, wife of the deceased K. Raja, after being convinced with the arguments of her counsel Henri Tiphagne that there was reasonable doubt of custodial torture by Villupuram police and therefore a re-postmortem must be conducted.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, if re-postmortem is conducted and the result negatives the contention of the writ petitioner, it would only enhance the reputation of the police among the public. Therefore, in the interest of justice, the re-postmortem must be conducted,\u201d the judge said.\n\nHe directed the DME as well as the Dean of Villupuram Government Medical Hospital to nominate forensic specialists from Madras Medical College in Chennai and KAP Viswanathan Government Medical College in Tiruchi for conducting the re-postmortem and identifying external injuries if any on the body.\n\nIf any of the doctors were unavailable, then the experts could be drawn either from Madurai Medical College or Tirunelveli Medical College. And If the experts were of the view that the re-postmortem must be conducted at the burial ground itself, then the norms laid down by the High Court in 2023 should be followed, he said.\n\n\u201cIf re-postmortem needs to be done on the spot, X-Ray examination shall be done mandatorily to find out the antemortem injuries, if any, on the deceased\u2019s body,\u201d the judge said and directed the Home Secretary to secure the CCTV footage of Villupuram Taluk police station from 6 a.m. on April 9 to 6 p.m. on April 11.\n\nAccording to the police, they had picked up Raja at 9:30 pm on April 10 after finding him to be in possession of 10 brandy bottles in a polythene bag near a liquor shop at Tirupachavadimedu. Since he attempted to flee, he was arrested and then let out on station bail at 10:50 a.m. on the same day, the police claimed.\n\nOn the other hand, the petitioner alleged that her husband was beaten up black and blue at the police station and fearing that he might die the police had released him on bail. After the release, he had visited a primary health care centre along with his friend before returning home.\n\nSince he complained of chest pain even after returning home, he was rushed to the Villupuram Government Hospital where he was declared brought dead at 1:30 p.m. on the same day. The petitioner claimed that her husband had narrated the entire brutality meted out to him before breathing his last.",

The fortnight has witnessed over 5-7 such cases, including 28-year old Ravina Dhurvey, who was killed by her husband when there was a slight delay in serving dinner while in another incident a group of friends stabbed one of their friends during a disagreement over \u2018dinner and drinks\u2019 session. Series of impulsive murders have brought spotlight on the surge in murder cases due to disputes, particularly petty quarrels in the State.\n\nThe latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data revealed that such cases have increased by 27% (691 in number) in Telangana in just one year between 2021-2022.\n\n\u201cMurder cases in the State are mostly \u2018in the moment\u2019 kind with only very few planned ones. This has been the case in the current year and in the recent years,\u201d explained Cyberabad Commissioner of Police Avinash Mohanty adding that the State has not seen many repeat offenders in murders, except rare cases of serial killers.\n\n\u201cToday we are in the era of high functional humans. The fuse is very short, and any minor thing can set people off. Most people are dealing with stress, unaddressed anxiety disorder and depression, and it goes unnoticed until an incident happens,\u201d mental health professional and therapist at Dhrithi Wellness Clinic Purnima Nagaraja said.\n\nThere are several factors at play, increasing anxiety and uncertainty in the post-pandemic era, lowering tolerance levels, lack of empathy and cognitive dissonance being the prominent ones, she added.\n\nIn the cases like that of the 28-year old Ravina Dhurvey (who was killed by her husband for a slight delay in serving dinner), the issue could also be the \u2018sense of entitlement\u2019 stemming from patriarchy, said a psychologist. Having said that, it is also the unaddressed depression and frustration among the males that can lead to such tendencies.\n\nOther factors that contribute, according to clinical psychologist at TherapHeal Poornima Chandrashekhar, include low socio-economic status, poor education levels, family history and poor emotional regulation right from young age. Meanwhile, lack of criminal profiling and in-depth criminal psychology studies along with dearth of platforms for professional counselling are adding to the woes, she said.\n\n\u201cEven though the Indian Penal Code is very stringent, a lot of what we call petty crimes often go unnoticed in the purview of the law. We wait till a woman is brutally killed and miss when the crime is in the making,\u201d Dr. Nagaraja said.\n\nUnderlining the paucity of hands in the psychiatrist and counselling domains, experts said that creating adequate platforms for professional counselling, ensuring accessibility and starting to address mental health concerns at an early age can help bring such cases down.",

The high overnight temperatures make this event particularly alarming,\u201d Andrew Pershing, VP for science at Climate Central, said.\n\nHeatwaves can be deadly, with the elderly and children particularly at risk of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. According to the World Health Organization, more than 1,66,000 people died as a result of heatwaves between 1998 and 2017.\n\nExtreme temperatures can also impact economies. People are less productive during hot weather, even if they work indoors, while children struggle to learn in extreme heat.\n\nA study in 2022 said extreme heat resulted in labor productivity loss of USD 2.1 trillion equivalent in 2017.\n\nOn Friday, the maximum temperature surged to 47.4 degrees Celsius in Najafgarh and 47.1 in Haryana's Sirsa.\n\nBefore this, Kalaikunda in Gangetic West Bengal had recorded a high of 47.2 degrees Celsius on April 30.\n\nThe threshold for a heat wave is met when the maximum temperature of a weather station reaches at least 40 degrees Celsius in the plains, 37 degrees in the coastal areas, and 30 degrees in the hilly regions, and the departure from normal is at least 4.5 notches.\n\nA severe heat wave is declared if the departure from normal exceeds 6.4 notches.\n\nApril witnessed record-smashing maximum temperatures in east, northeast, and southern peninsular India, prompting health warnings from government agencies and a few states to suspend in-person classes in schools.\n\nSeveral places recorded their highest-ever April day temperatures, with the mercury soaring to 47 degrees Celsius.\n\nAt least two people died in Kerala due to suspected heatstroke during this period.\n\nOn Wednesday, a group of leading climate scientists said similar heat waves could occur once every 30 years, and these have already become about 45 times more likely due to climate change.\n\nThe scientists from the World Weather Attribution group emphasised that heat waves intensified by climate change are making life much tougher for people living in poverty across Asia.\n\nThe IMD had earlier warned of extreme heat in India during the April-June period, coinciding with the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections that end on June 1.",

        "publish_date": "2024-05-18",
        "text": "Even while no case of H5N1 infection in humans has been reported after consuming raw milk, scientists believe that the virus can be transmitted via an infected cow\u2019s milk that has not been pasteurised. The lone reported human case in the current outbreak in cattle spread across 49 herds in nine States in the U.S. has been a dairy farm worker who had direct exposure to cows and developed conjunctivitis. The Atlanta-based CDC has advised people to desist from consuming uncooked dairy food products such as raw, unpasteurised milk, or raw cheeses from animals with suspected or confirmed H5N1 bird flu virus infection.\n\nWhile FAO noted that H5N1 virus was detected in \u201chigh concentrations in milk from infected dairy cattle and at levels greater than that seen in respiratory samples\u201d, there are no reports of viable H5N1 virus being found in raw milk samples. \u201cI have not come across any report of actual isolation of influenza viruses from raw milk. Most reports on viral loads in milk are based on molecular sequencing data rather than actual isolation of the virus from milk. It will be RT-PCR or sequencing of fragments,\u201d immunologist Dr. Vineeta Bal, a visiting faculty at IISER Pune says in an email to The Hindu.\n\nDespite CDC warning people to avoid consuming raw milk, sales of raw milk in the U.S. has increased sharply since the H5N1 outbreak in cattle was first reported there on March 25 this year. Yet, there has not been any reported case of human infection after raw milk intake. Even as it makes eminent sense to avoid consuming raw milk especially in places where H5N1 outbreak in cattle has been reported in the U.S., how likely are people to be infected with H5N1 via raw milk? \u201cWe need to remember that viruses outside a cell do not have life of their own. The biological plausibility of transmission through milk is very limited,\u201d Dr. Chandrakant Lahariya, physician epidemiologist and a public policy and health systems expert says in an email to The Hindu.\n\n\u201cThere are very few human cases reported so far and almost all of those were in farm workers who had come in close contact with infected animals. In these cases, the likely route of transmission was airborne. Raw milk from H5N1 infected cows may not cause illness in humans as the route of introduction of the virus is oral rather than nasopharyngeal,\u201d says Dr. Bal. \u201cTheoretical possibility of a human being catching H5N1 infection from infected raw milk is very low. Till date, there has been no documented evidence of H5N1 transmission from animals to humans via the oral route.\u201d\n\nDr. Bal goes further to underscore the odds of H5N1 infection in humans through consumption of raw milk. \u201cAlmost all human influenza virus infections are primarily respiratory infections unlike in some other mammals where gut infections are reported. Based on that it can be stated that consumption of heavily infected H5N1 containing raw milk is unlikely to cause illness in human beings.\u201d\n\nThere are many reports of cats being infected with H5N1 in the current outbreak in the U.S. In a recent study, domestic cats fed with raw, unpasteurised colostrum and milk from affected cows developed fatal systemic influenza infection, thus demonstrating the oral route of transmission in cats. \u201cSome birds (poultry) as well as cats do show susceptibility to influenza virus infections via oral route. So far humans have not been infected by faeco-oral route even if the virus is shed by humans in the excreta.

Many academically talented poor students pin their hopes on the NTSE monthly scholarship as it continues till they complete their studies.\n\nThe exam was scheduled and postponed in 2021, after many students had even paid the fees, due to the pandemic. NCERT has not been seeking applications since then.\n\n\u201cI applied for NTSE in 2021 when I was in class 10, and now I am doing my undergraduate studies, but the exam hasn\u2019t been held till now, even as the country has passed over the pandemic crisis and all other national exams are being held regularly,\u201d said Rajesh S., a student.\n\nHow exams are held\n\nThe NTSE exam has two stages. The State-level examination (Stage 1), held by the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT), is divided into two parts: part 1 is the mental aptitude test, and part 2 is the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). The national-level examination (Stage 2), held by NCERT, is conducted for candidates who qualify in the Stage 1 examination.\n\nThe candidates who pass NTSE will get a scholarship of \u20b91,250 per month up to completion of class 12 and \u20b92,000 a month in undergraduate and postgraduate courses. An NTSE scholar also gets a scholarship for a Ph.D. as per the University Grant Commission norms.\n\nOther advantages\n\nApart from scholarships, NTSE scholars have other facilities. Several prestigious institutes reserve seats for NTSE scholars, who are inducted without entrance tests. They are also perceived to have an edge when studying in foreign universities.\n\nThe last time NCERT sought applications for NTSE was in 2021, and the exam was scheduled to be held on December 15, 2021. However, due to the second wave of the pandemic, it was temporarily postponed and has not been held since.\n\nSumangala V., Director, DSERT, said they had not received any information from NCERT about holding NTSE for three years now. However, she added that on behalf of the State government, they were conducting the National Means cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme (NMMSS) exam and providing scholarships to talented students of the State.",

Rumblings have begun on both fronts with key contenders such as the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) in the UDF, and the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Kerala Congress (M) in the LDF in the reckoning.\n\nThe six-year tenure of three Rajya Sabha seats, currently held by CPI(M) leader Elamaram Kareem, CPI State secretary Binoy Viswam, and Kerala Congress (M) chairman Jose K. Mani, will end on July 1. Interestingly, Mr. Mani retained his position after his party defected from the UDF to the LDF.\n\nHow the CPI(M) and the Congress tactfully deal with their allies will add another layer of complexity to the coalition politics in Kerala. The Congress has already made an unsuccessful attempt to woo back the KC(M) into its fold.\n\nBased on the strength of legislators in the State Assembly, as was the case with the previous State government, two seats will go in favour of the LDF, while the remaining one to the UDF.\n\nIUML stance\n\nThe IUML leadership believes that it has already struck a pact on the lone winnable Rajya Sabha seat when the party sought a third seat on the eve of the Lok Sabha elections.\n\nAlthough the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) has reluctantly accepted the proposal, the party\u2019s Central leadership has not yet endorsed it. The Congress is concerned that its dominant partner, the IUML, would gain an upper hand in Rajya Sabha. At present, both the IUML and the Congress have a member each. The Congress may have to resort to political brinkmanship instead of yielding to the minority pressure tactics of the IUML, sources said.\n\nWayanad byelection question\n\nHowever a victory for Congress leader Rahul Gandhi from both Wayanad and Rae Bareli in the Lok Sabha elections could provide the IUML with an opportunity to wrestle with the Congress for the Wayanad seat in the byelection. While it is almost a foregone conclusion that the party\u2019s de facto chief will win again in Wayanad, a defeat in Rae Bareli would close that chapter.\n\nIn the case of the CPI(M), the party will have to take a call to accommodate its traditional partner, the CPI, and then offer the second seat to the KC(M). The CPI(M) is keen on retaining the support of the KC(M), which had significantly contributed to the LDF\u2019s electoral success in the three-tier local body elections in 2020 and the Assembly elections in 2021.",

        "title": "Watch | Israel\u2019s Rafah invasion | Explained",
        "publish_date": "2024-05-18",
        "text": "The pre-war population of Rafah, the southernmost city of the Gaza strip sharing a border with Egypt\u2019s Sinai Peninsula, was 1,70,000. Today, seven months after Israel launched its war on Gaza, as many as 1.5 million people are living in Rafah. Many of them are camped on the streets and beaches, while others are cramped into filthy, overcrowded makeshift shelters.\n\nRafah is now a \u201cgigantic refugee camp\u201d, says the Norwegian Refugee Council. According to a doctor who served in Rafah, the city is a \u201cclosed jail\u201d. Medics are struggling to supply even basic aid and prevent the outbreak and spread of diseases. According to Action Aid, every single person in Gaza \u201cis now hungry and people have just 1.5 to 2 litres of unsafe water per day to meet all their needs\u201d. A majority of Gaza\u2019s population is now jammed in Rafah. It is in this Rafah, Israel is carrying out its latest offensive.\n\nRafah has always been a flashpoint in the Israel-Palestine conflict, given its territorial proximity to Egypt. After the 1948 Arab-Israel war, Rafah came under Egyptian rule along with other parts of the Gaza Strip. Tens of thousands of Palestinians who were displaced from their homes when Israel was created were settled in Gaza.\n\nDuring the Suez Crisis, Rafah came under attack when the Israeli troops were marching towards Sinai through Gaza. On November 12, 1956, the IDF raided a refugee camp in Rafah, killing at least 111 Palestinians, which came to be known as the Rafah massacre.\n\nAfter the Six-Day War of 1967, the entire Gaza, including Rafah, came under Israel\u2019s direct military occupation. Israel would retain its direct control over the enclave until 2005.\n\nAfter the latest war began on October 7, 2023, Israel ordered over 1 million Palestinians living in the northern Gaza to evacuate. Most of them fled their homes and moved to southern cities such as Khan Younis and Rafah. When Khan Younis was attacked, there was another flight of refugees towards the south. Today, the lion\u2019s share of Rafah\u2019s population are internally displaced Palestinians.\n\nBefore Israel launched the Rafah offensive, there were dramatic developments. The U.S. had warned Israel against launching a full-scale invasion of Rafah, arguing that such an attack would kill more Palestinian civilians. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that Israel would go ahead with the plan to invade Rafah, defying international pressure, warnings and pleas. But Mr. Netanyahu is also under pressure to bring the remaining hostages back. Israel says 128 hostages abducted on October 7 are still in Hamas\u2019s captivity, though many of them are feared dead. There are growing protests in Israel, asking the government to strike a deal with Hamas to bring the hostages back. Israel and Hamas, helped by mediators such as the U.S., Egypt and Qatar, had held multiple rounds of talks in Cairo for a ceasefire deal.\n\nWhile the fine details of the ceasefire proposal were not made public yet, reports in Egyptian and Saudi media suggested that the mediators had proposed a three-phase deal that would see the release of all hostages and Palestinian prisoners and eventually bring the war to an end. In the first phase, Israel was expected to cease fire for 40 days and free Palestinian prisoners in return for the release of 33 hostages.\n\nIn the second phase, the ceasefire would be extended by 42 more days, while all the remaining living hostages would be released.\n\nThe third phase proposals were the most contentious. Israel wanted Hamas to release the bodies of all hostages and Hamas wanted a comprehensive, lasting ceasefire and full withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nIsrael says no to both Hamas demands. Israeli troops have been deployed in northern and central Gaza, effectively carving the northern tip of the strip as a buffer zone between Israel proper and Gaza\u2019s population. If the Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza, Israeli officials say, Palestinians as well as Hamas militants would return to the areas close to the Israeli border. And if Israel agrees to a lasting ceasefire, the remaining Hamas battalions would survive.\n\nWhen Israel launched the war on October 7, it made its twin objectives public: dismantle Hamas and release the hostages. Seven months after the war, in which roughly 35,000 Palestinians have been killed, Israel has not met either of the objectives. One practical solution to the hostage crisis is to strike a deal with Hamas. But Hamas would release the hostages only in return for a ceasefire. And if Israel agrees for a ceasefire, Hamas would survive. This is the dilemma Mr. Netanyahu is facing.\n\nEarlier, Biden administration officials had said Hamas was the major stumbling block for a ceasefire. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated on May 4 that \u201cthe only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas\u201d. But on May 6, Hamas\u2019s Doha-based leader Ismail Haniyeh said the group accepted the ceasefire proposal suggested by the mediators in Cairo. The Hamas announcement came hours after the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) ordered at least 100,000 Palestinians to evacuate from Rafah. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government immediately rejected the Hamas offer, saying it did not meet Israel\u2019s core demands. The Prime Minister later said Israel would never agree to end the war in Gaza as part of a deal with Hamas.\n\nMr. Netanyahu\u2019s tough line on Rafah has created tensions in Israel\u2019s ties with the U.S. Earlier President Biden had said a full-scale attack on Rafah without a proper plan to protect civilians would be a redline for him. The United Nations has repeatedly warned that any attack on the overcrowded Rafah would lead to a humanitarian catastrophe. If he abandons the plan to attack Rafah and cuts a deal with Hamas for hostages, Netanyahu\u2019s government could fall as his far-right allies such as Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have already warned against such a move. If he goes ahead with the plan to invade Rafah, more Palestinian civilians would be killed, Israel would further be isolated globally and tensions would rise in ties with the U.S. But Mr. Netanyahu doesn\u2019t seem to bother.\n\n\u201cIf Israel has to stand alone, it will stand alone,\u201d he said on May 10, less than a month after American, British, French and Jordanian defence systems, along with the IDF, shot down most of the drones and cruise and ballistic missiles launched by Iran towards Israel.\n\nRead more:Israel\u2019s \u2018limited\u2019 military operation in Rafah | Explained\n\nScript and presentation: Stanly Johny\n\nVideo: Thamodharan B.\n\nProduction: Ravichandran N.",

        "title": "HPV vaccine prevents cervical cancer cases in deprived groups: study",
        "publish_date": "2024-05-18",
        "text": "The human papillomavirus, or HPV, vaccine is cutting cases of cervical cancer right across the socio-economic spectrum, with most cases being prevented in more deprived groups, according to a major study funded by Cancer Research UK.\n\nUntil now, there had been concerns that the HPV vaccine could have an unequal impact across society. After carrying out the longest follow-up on the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine, researchers at the Queen Mary University of London concluded the HPV vaccination programme in England is helping to close some inequalities in cervical cancer. The results were published in the journal BMJ.\n\nDue to a typically higher incidence of cervical cancer in more deprived groups, researchers found that more cases were prevented in the most deprived group (around 190), compared to the least deprived group (around 60) in a study that included approximately 6,50,000 people offered vaccination aged 12-18 years in each of the five deprivation groups. The study reflected the huge success of the school-based vaccination programme, showing that well-executed public health interventions can help to reduce health inequalities.\n\nThe study adds even more weight to evidence that HPV vaccination works. Researchers found that over a 12-year period, the vaccine reduced cervical cancer incidence rates by nearly 90% and pre-cancerous conditions by around 95% in women who were offered routine vaccination at 12-13 years old in England. The study shows that the vaccine is much more effective when taken up by children aged eight years (12-13 years) than later in life.\n\nAlthough the life-saving HPV vaccine currently reaches people from all backgrounds, Cancer Research UK warns that some inequalities remain in cervical cancer incidence, and more work is needed to improve the health of the most deprived groups. Overall, cervical cancer rates are higher in people from deprived backgrounds across the U.K. Researchers said this is partly due to people being at greater risk from HPV and barriers that can drive lower screening attendance.\n\nCancer Research U.K. scientists helped to prove the link between HPV and cervical cancer 25 years ago. Cervical cancer rates in the U.K. have fallen by almost a third since the early 1990s. The HPV vaccination programme was first introduced to England in 2008.",

Care should be taken by all so that the disease outbreak in an area does not spread further in the community.\n\nUnhygienic handling of food being one of the major reasons for the spread of hepatitis A, food handlers in eateries and food businesses should necessarily have a valid health card. Those who suspect that they might have contracted hepatitis should not be working in eateries or handle food. Food Safety authorities have been directed to intensify their checks.\n\nSuperchlorination of water sources like wells is an important control measure during a hepatitis outbreak. However, it should be noted that the virus does not get destroyed even if the water is run through a purifier.Only water that has been previously boiled and cooled is safe to drink.\n\nThe Healtrh department also advises people to seek medical treatment as soon as the initial symptoms are seen. People should also stay away from unproven or pseudo scientific remedies which could complicate the disease. The elderly, children, pregnant women, and those with comorbidities require special attention and care .\n\nThe health advisory also states that those infected as well the caregivers take some special precautions while the infected person is recovering from the illness.\n\nThis include avoiding close contact, including sexual contact, with others outside the house and staying away from handling food or drinks. As the disease spreads through the faeco-oral route, hands should be washed with soap and water frequently, especially before eating food and after using the toilet.\n\nBleach solution should be used to clean the toilet and other surfaces used by the infected person. In hostels or dormitories, an infected person should be given separate accommodation. The clothes or other personal belongings of an infected person should not be used by others. Clothes used by the infected person should be washed using a disinfectant or bleach solution.\n\nThe advisory also states that handrub solutions containing alcohol are not useful to prevent hepatitis virus spread.",

        "text": "Fifty years ago, India conducted its first nuclear test in Pokhran, code-named Operation Smiling Buddha. With this India had entered the league of nations with nuclear capabilities.\n\nAn article dated May 19th, 1974, says India successfully conducted an underground test with plutonium device in 10-15 kiloton range. It also adds that the then Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission Dr H.N Sethna and Director of The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre DR R Ramanna, who supervised the test, flew to Delhi even without a wash or change to give a full account to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.\n\nIndia said that it undertook this programme to develop its own technology for peaceful use of nuclear energy and it had no intention of going in for nuclear weapons. The groundwork for testing nuclear energy was laid even earlier by renowned Indian scientists Homi J Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai. In 1954, the Department of Atomic Energy was founded, with Bhabha as director.\n\nWith Smiling Buddha, India became the first nation to conduct a nuclear test apart from the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. After the nuclear test, there were criticisms that it was an attempt to divert people\u2019s attention from the economic crisis the country was facing in the 1970s.\n\nHowever, the Atomic Energy Commission chairman said that it was his decision and that there was no political motive, Even a New York Times article said that \u201csuch great talent of resources has been squandered on the vanity of power, while 600 million Indians slip deeper into poverty\u201d.\n\nIndia also faced significant criticism from many countries including Pakistan, USA, and Canada. Pakistan said that it would never succumb to \u201cnuclear blackmail\u201d or accept \u201cIndian hegemony or domination over the subcontinent\u201d.\n\nIndia did not carry out further nuclear tests until 1998. In 1998, under the leadership of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, India conducted a series of nuclear tests in Pokhran once again, code-named Operation Shakti.\n\nWith this, India declared itself a full-fledged nuclear state.\n\nScript and production: Gayatri Menon\n\nResearch: Gayatri Menon and Murali Krishnaswamy\n\nArchive photo courtesy: M.

Jawahar Reddy, and the Director General of Police (DGP), Harish Kumar Gupta, met the Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar in New Delhi and explained about the violence that took place in A.P. when the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) is in force.\n\nThe Election Commission of India (ECI), which directed the CS and the DGP to take stern action against the culprits involved in the violence, approved the State\u2019s proposal to go for a probe by a SIT into the incidents.\n\nMr. Jawahar Reddy told the ECI that transfer of the Palnadu district Collector and the Tirupati Superintendent of Police (SP), and suspension of Palnadu and Anantapur SPs, and 12 subordinate police officers in the three districts has been proposed, to which the Election Commission has immediately given its nod. He also told the ECI that a departmental inquiry has been initiated against all the above mentioned officers.\n\nThe ECI referred to the violent incidents reported in Palnadu, Anantapur and Tirupati districts. It also mentioned the incidents of assault, damaging property and campaign vehicles, threatening, and stone-pelting before the elections in Chittoor, Guntur, Annamayya and Nandyal districts.\n\nSIT, headed by Inspector General of Police (IGP) Vineet Brijlal, will not only probe into the incidents of violence, and oversee the cases filed on the incidents but also make necessary recommendations to register fresh FIRs.\n\nVarious teams of SIT reached the violence-hit districts and started their operations.",

        "publish_date": "2024-05-18",
        "text": "Researchers from the Zoological Survey of India, in partnership with the Andhra Pradesh Biodiversity Board, rediscovered the Sri Lankan golden-backed frog (Hylarana gracilis) after two centuries in the Koundinya wildlife sanctuary in the Chittoor district, the southernmost point of the Eastern Ghats in Andhra Pradesh. With this finding, the number of freshwater frog species in India rises to 20.\n\nBharath Bhupathi from the Zoological Survey of India, Hyderabad, encountered frogs of this species near a pond in the forest and suspected that it could be a new species. However, after consulting taxonomic experts and utilising morphological and DNA barcoding tools, the species was confirmed to be the Sri Lankan golden-backed frog Hylarana gracilis.\n\nMr. Bhupathi emphasizes that rediscovery is more significant than the discovery of a new species, as it provides evidence for the historic land bridge between India and Sri Lanka.\n\nAmphibians are recognised as ecological indicators of healthy ecosystems, and the Eastern Ghats are home to 27 species of amphibians, considerably fewer than the Western Ghats.\n\nThe study is the result of the collaborative efforts of multiple scientists, including Deepa Jaiswal, S.S. Jadhav, and Karuthapandi. M. from ZSI, Hyderabad, and K.P. Dinesh from ZSI, Pune, in collaboration with the researcher, Kalyani Kunte of Andhra Pradesh Biodiversity Board.\n\nDistrict Forest Officer (Chittoor) C. Chaitanya Kumar Reddy said that the finding of the exotic species in the Palamaner range of Chittoor is a welcome sign for the region, and \u201call steps would be taken to protect the species.\u201c\n\nIn the present scenario, the Sri Lankan golden-backed frog populations in India and Sri Lanka are approximately 800 km apart. Additionally, there is a shallow genetic divergence of 0.2% to 1% genetic distance between these populations, supporting the evidence of changes in sea level in the late Pleistocene period or the Ice Age, resulting in land connections between India and Sri Lanka.",

He said building \u201csmarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor\u201d and that the company \u201cis shouldering an enormous responsibility on behalf of all of humanity.\u201d\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\n\u201cOpenAI must become a safety-first AGI company,\u201d wrote Leike, using the abbreviated version of artificial general intelligence, a futuristic vision of machines that are as broadly smart as humans or at least can do many things as well as people can.\n\nOpen AI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a reply to Leike's posts that he was \u201csuper appreciative\u201d of Leike's contributions to the company was \u201cvery sad to see him leave.\u201d\n\nLeike is \"right we have a lot more to do; we are committed to doing it,\u201d Altman said, pledging to write a longer post on the subject in the coming days.\n\nThe company also confirmed Friday that it had disbanded Leike's Superalignment team, which was launched last year to focus on AI risks, and is integrating the team's members across its research efforts.\n\nLeike\u2019s resignation came after OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever said Tuesday that he was leaving the company after nearly a decade. Sutskever was one of four board members last fall who voted to push out Altman \u2014 only to quickly reinstate him. It was Sutskever who told Altman last November that he was being fired, but he later said he regretted doing so.\n\nSutskever said he is working on a new project that's meaningful to him without offering additional details. He will be replaced by Jakub Pachocki as chief scientist. Altman called Pachocki \u201calso easily one of the greatest minds of our generation\u201d and said he is \u201cvery confident he will lead us to make rapid and safe progress towards our mission of ensuring that AGI benefits everyone.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, OpenAI showed off the latest update to its artificial intelligence model, which can mimic human cadences in its verbal responses and can even try to detect people\u2019s moods.",

        "text": "Covid-19 may not be raging any more, but a controversy over the AstraZeneca vaccine, sold as Covishield in India is. The issue first erupted when AstraZeneca, in a submission to a court in the UK, acknowledged that its vaccine could cause a rare, potentially life-threatening condition, known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome or TTS. This led to everything from outrage on social media, to political parties issuing statements and to a host of misinformation being circulated. What is significant is that this information about TTS is not new \u2013 it was established as early as in 2021, when India\u2019s vaccination programme was underway, and it has been a known fact now for well over three years. Just a short time after the court submission made headlines, AstraZeneca also announced the worldwide withdrawal of its vaccine, citing a decline in the demand. As of this year, India has administered over 1.5 billion doses of Covishield to its eligible population.\n\nWhat led to the furore over the vaccine\u2019s rare side effect and what do we know about it? How robust is India\u2019s system to monitor adverse events arising from vaccinations? And what happens to India\u2019s vaccination programme if Covishield is no longer available \u2013 are there other options available for those who need them or for future immunisations?\n\nGuest: Dr Anurag Agrawal, Dean, BioSciences and Health Research, Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University\n\nHost: Zubeda Hamid\n\nEdited by Sharmada Venkatasubramanian.\n\nListen to more In Focus podcasts:",

The Chief Minister indicated that if the Cabinet meeting doesn\u2019t take place the ministers may have to visit the barrages and pump houses.",

It killed nine people and wounded dozens. The perpetrators of this heinous act of terror are yet to be brought to justice.\n\nRecords show that the youngest victim was 12-year-old Mohammed Sameer, while the others were identified as 25-year-old Mohammed Jaffer and Sk. Mohd Nayeem, 17-year-old Md Azeem, 18-year-old Mohammed Riyaz, 27-year-old Shafiq-ur-Rahman, 36-year-old Yusuf Khan and 28-year-old Sajed Ali Khan, the ninth victim remained unidentified. The blast injured as many as 58 others.\n\nIn April 2018, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Special Court acquitted the accused \u2014 Devendra Gupta, Lokesh Sharma, Bharath Mohan Lal Rateshwar and Rajendra Choundary, and Naba Kumar Sarkar alias Swami Aseemanand. The NIA chose not to go in for an appeal.\n\nSoon after the blast, the protesting crowd became restive which prompted the police to open fire. As many as five people were killed.\n\nHours after the blast, the Hussaini Alam Police Station registered cases under Sections 302, 307 and 120 B of the Indian Penal Code, along with relevant sections of the Explosive Substances Act. The Central Bureau of Investigation took up investigation after re-registering the case. The case was then transferred to the National Investigation Agency.\n\nIn June 2007, the government of undivided Andhra Pradesh constituted the V. Bhaskara Rao Commission to probe the police firing. While the Commission submitted a report, it has not been tabled in the Telangana State Legislative Assembly.\n\nMeanwhile, civil society members on Saturday released a statement demanding reopening of the case and a thorough re-investigation. Lawyer Syed Mounis Jafar Abidi and activists Kaneez Fathia, S Q Masood, Sara Mathews, Ali Asghar, and Khalida Parveen also demanded that the Telangana government file an intervention petition, and the Congress government, which recently took the reins, \u201cset an example\u201d and \u201ccommitment to justice\u201d by swiftly tabling the V. Bhaskara Rao Commission report.",

However, officials said that strengthening pre-monsoon showers in Kerala, outbreaks of infectious diseases, and the threat of landslips and flooding had possibly compelled him to shorten his holiday.\n\nThey said the Chief Minister is reportedly scheduled to review the State\u2019s monsoon and disaster management preparedness. The rains are expected to intensify over Kerala in the next few days.\n\nThe Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition had earlier attempted to stir a controversy about the alleged secrecy surrounding Mr. Vijayan\u2019s foreign tour.\n\nLeader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan had alleged that Mr. Vijayan had left a State reeling from a scorching summer in the lurch and criticised him for not handing over the charge of the former\u2019s office to a Cabinet colleague.\n\nDuring Mr. Vijayan\u2019s absence, the Opposition had accused the police of doing little to curb violent street crimes. It slammed the law enforcement for its alleged apathy to complainants, including victims of domestic violence.\n\nHowever, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] had defended Mr. Vijayan\u2019s holiday. CPI(M) State secretary M.V. Govindan had said Mr. Vijayan had sought the party\u2019s sanction to go abroad. Earlier, the Mr. Vijayan had received the Centre\u2019s consent for travel.\n\nCPI(M) State secretariat member A.K. Balan said Mr. Vijayan had paid for his private travel. Quoting the Bible, Mr. Balan noted that even \u201cGod had rested seven days after creation\u201d.\n\nMr. Balan said Mr. Vijayan had taken tremendous strain during the Lok Sabha election campaign and was deeply involved in electioneering across Kerala.\n\nMr. Vijayan had chaired Cabinet meetings online during his foreign trip and received daily briefs from officials.",

Sports help you to achieve your goals. Every student must make it a habit to engage in a sport along with studies.\u201d\n\nZilla Panchayat CEO K.M. Gayathri said the responsibilities go up when a student scores the highest marks in exams. Success has to be handled by understanding your responsibilities.\n\nThe environment where you studied will change once you enter college.

The district was placed in the 16th position in the 2022 examination and its ranking slipped last year but made a big comeback this year, putting up an incredible show.\n\nOut of 38,175 students who appeared for the examination in the district, 32,639 students passed out of the examination, registering a pass percentage of 85.5. Like last year, the girls have outshined boys with 92 per cent results while the boys have secured 85.2 per cent results.",

        "text": "Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico 's condition was serious but stable on May 18 as the man accused of trying to assassinate him faced his first court appearance.\n\nTwo hours of surgery on May 17 to remove dead tissue from Fico's multiple gunshot wounds led to a good prognosis for his recovery but he was still not well enough to travel to a hospital in the capital, Bratislava, government ministers said outside University F D Roosevelt Hospital in Banska Bystrica, where Fico was taken by helicopter after the shooting.\n\n\u201cSeveral miracles have occurred in Banska Bystrica in recent days coming from the hands of doctors, nurses and the personnel at the Roosevelt Hospital,\" Defence Minister Robert Kalinak said.\n\nMr. Fico, 59, was attacked as he greeted supporters following a government meeting Wednesday in the former coal mining town of Handlova. The suspect was tackled to the ground and arrested.\n\nThe update on Mr. Fico's health was issued as the man accused of attempting to assassinate him made his first court appearance, according to Slovak state media.\n\nProsecutors were seeking an order from Slovakia's Specialised Criminal Court to detain the suspect.\n\nProsecutors told police not to publicly identify the man or release other details about the case, but unconfirmed media reports said he was a 71-year-old retiree known as an amateur poet who may have once worked as a mall security guard in the country's southwest.\n\nGovernment authorities gave details that matched that description. They said the suspect didn't belong to any political groups, though the attack itself was politically motivated.\n\nThe courthouse in Pezinok, a small town outside the capital, Bratislava, was guarded by officers wearing balaclavas and carrying rifles. News media were not allowed in and reporters were kept behind a gate outside.\n\nPolice on Friday had taken the suspect to his home in the town of Levice and seized a computer and some documents, Markiza, a Slovak television station reported. Police didn't comment.\n\nWith police remaining largely silent about the case, it was not clear how the suspect came to possess a firearm.\n\nSlovakia has strict rules on firearms and gun owners must have a good reason to possess one and are required to pass a test.\n\nAs a consequence, Slovakia has one of the lowest gun ownership rates in Europe. It was ranked 23rd out of 27 European Union countries with a gun ownership rate of 6.5 per 100 people, according to the Association of Accredited Public Policy Advocates to the EU.\n\nWorld leaders have condemned the attack and offered support for Fico and Slovakia.\n\nFico has long been a divisive figure in Slovakia and beyond. His return to power last year on a pro-Russia, anti-American platform led to worries among fellow European Union and NATO members that he would abandon his country's pro-Western course, particularly on Ukraine.\n\nAt the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Slovakia was one of Ukraine's staunchest supporters, but Fico halted arms deliveries to Ukraine when he returned to power, his fourth time serving as prime minister.\n\nFico's government has also made efforts to overhaul public broadcasting \u2014 a move critics said would give the government full control of public television and radio. That, coupled with his plans to amend the penal code to eliminate a special anti-graft prosecutor, have led opponents to worry that Fico will lead Slovakia down a more autocratic path.\n\nThousands of demonstrators have repeatedly rallied in the capital and around the country of 5.4 million to protest his policies.\n\nFico said last month on Facebook that he believed rising tensions in the country could lead to the killing of politicians, and he blamed the media for fuelling tensions.\n\nBefore Fico returned to power last year, many of his political and business associates were the focus of police investigations, and dozens have been charged.\n\nHis plan to overhaul the penal system would eliminate the office of the special prosecutor that deals with organised crime, corruption and extremism.",

Despite his prior arrest, he continued to cheat aspirants,\u201d said the official.\n\nHe obtains phone numbers of victims through WhatsApp job groups and informs them about backlog posts for Inspector rank in the Income Tax Department and TTE (Group-C) in the SCR.\n\n\u201cIn a similar manner, he trapped one Shaik Hussian by promising him an Inspector job in the Income Tax department at Patna. Believing his assurances, Shaik Hussian travelled to Patna and received a fake joining letter. Later, Anil Kumar offered him a position at SCR, Secunderabad. Under the guise of training, Hussian worked as a Train Ticket Examiner (TTE) for six months under the guidance of TTE Naveen Kumar, for which Anil Kumar collected \u20b910 lakh,\u201d explained the official.\n\nSimilarly, the accused also deceived A. Rajesh by promising to facilitate the purchase of a software company for him, collecting \u20b985,000 but failing to deliver.\n\nThe accused men Anil Kumar and Naveen Kumar were handed over to the Gopalapuram police for further investigation.",

        "publish_date": "2024-05-18",
        "text": "Researchers have discovered specific networks of neurons in fruit flies that respond selectively to various hues. Hue denotes the perceived colors associated with specific wavelengths, or combinations of wavelengths of light, which themselves are not inherently colourful. These hue-selective neurons lie within the optic lobe, the brain area responsible for vision. Scientists had previously reported finding neurons in animals\u2019 brains that respond selectively to different colors or hues, say, red or green. But no one had been able to trace the neural mechanisms making this hue selectivity possible. Now, the researchers have been able to find the fly brain connections. The intricate map details how some 130,000 neurons and 50 million synapses in a fruit-fly\u2019s poppy seed-sized brain are interconnected. With the connectome serving as a reference, the researchers used their observations of brain cells to develop a diagram they suspected represents the neuronal circuitry behind hue selectivity. These were then portrayed as mathematical models to simulate and probe the circuits\u2019 activities and capabilities. The modeling helped reveal that these circuits can host activity required for hue selectivity and also pointed to a type of cell-to-cell interconnectivity, known as recurrence, without which hue-selectivity cannot happen.",

        "text": "Thousands of Tamils on May 18 converged in Mullaivaikkal, along Sri Lanka\u2019s north-eastern coast, to pay homage to their relatives killed in May 2009, in the final battle of the island\u2019s protracted civil war.\n\nAs the war escalated before its gruesome end, lakhs of Tamil civilians were pushed to this narrow strip of land, declared a \u2018No Fire Zone\u2019 by the government. Tens of thousands, including women and children, died in the indiscriminate shelling of the armed forces, while scores were seriously injured.\n\nFamilies gathered at the venue on Saturday and placed photographs of their loved ones in the sandy ground near the sea, offered prayers with flowers, food, and by lighting lamps. Antony Jesurathnam Mariapushparani, a Mullaitivu resident, has vivid images from May 18, fifteen years ago.\n\n\u201cOnly those of us who were here know how many children died, how many senior citizens died. I saw how they just stacked up bodies in tractors and dropped them here,\u201d she said. Pointing to the main road adjacent to the venue, she said, \u201cit was there that we had our last kanji (porridge).\u201d\n\nTo recall those desperate times, many Tamils prepare and serve kanji in the run up to May 18, marking the period as \u2018Mullivaikkal remembrance week\u2019, or as \u2018Tamil Genocide Remembrance Day\u2019 by some. Earlier this week, four Tamils were arrested in the Eastern Province while they were serving kanji, after police obtained a court order citing reasons of \u201cpublic health\u201d and revival of \u201cterrorist activities\u201d. The three women and a man were granted bail yesterday, amid sharp criticism of the government for \u201csuppressing\u201d Tamils\u2019 right to memorialise.\n\nFifteen years after the war ended, with allegations of serious violations of human rights and international law, survivors are relentlessly demanding the whereabouts of their missing relatives, among some 60,000 forcibly disappeared persons.\n\n\u201cSri Lanka\u2019s Government must take meaningful action to determine and disclose the fates and whereabouts of tens of thousands of people who have been subjected to enforced disappearance over the decades and hold those responsible to account,\u201d a UN Human Rights Office report released this week said. Further, it called on the Sri Lankan government to acknowledge \u201cthe involvement of State security forces and affiliated paramilitary groups, and to issue a public apology.\u201d\n\nRights Watchdog Amnesty International\u2019s Secretary General Agn\u00e8s Callamard was in Mullaitivu to participate in the remembrance event. \u201cBetween Gaza and its 34,000 dead, Russia invading Ukraine, Myanmar crisis, Ethiopia and Sudan, there is a risk that the Sri Lankan conflict could be forgotten, That is why we are here, we don\u2019t want the pain, suffering, loss of lives to fall off the agenda.\u201d Amnesty would remind the international community that the search for justice in Sri Lanka must be answered, she said.",

        "publish_date": "2024-05-18",
        "text": "On a hot Saturday morning, plastic chairs have been lined up in the corner of a big hall at the Indraprastha post office in central Delhi. Around a dozen Pakistani Hindus, all related to each other, soon occupy the chairs and await their turn for an interview with government officials in the office of the Senior Postmaster. An official emerges from the room, matches the names on a bunch of files in his possession and calls them inside one by one.\n\nThey have applied for citizenship under the newly implemented Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019.\n\nKanwar Lal came to India on a pilgrimage visa with his wife and children in June 2014. After the CAA Rules were notified on March 11, paving the way for the implementation of the legislation passed by the Parliament in December 2019, Mr. Lal applied online for citizenship by naturalisation on April 27. Last week, he got an SMS to reach the Indraprastha Post Office on Saturday at 11 am.\n\n\u201cI had the file with all the documents. This includes an eligibility certificate issued by the priest of Shiv Mandir near our refugee colony. The officials interviewed me for around 40 minutes, asked me detailed questions but eventually turned down my application. They have asked me to apply again as an affidavit to be attested by a notary was missing,\u201d said Mr. Lal.\n\nThough the legislation was brought in for undocumented migrants, the Rules specify several documents that are to be uploaded on the portal including a document issued by a government authority in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. While applications are pouring in from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and Delhi where Pakistani Hindus who entered India legally are concentrated, there is no confirmation about people applying for citizenship under CAA in West Bengal and Assam. Matuas and Namasudras who fled Bangladesh fearing religious persecution and settled in West Bengal, and Bengali Hindus, excluded from Assam\u2019s National Register of Citizens (NRC) in 2015, are the other intended beneficiaries.\n\nAt least 14 people from Mr. Lal\u2019s neighbourhood at Majnu Ka Tila in North Delhi were conferred citizenship on May 15 by Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla.\n\nAmar Nath Advani, 44, who sells mobile phone covers for a living near Majnu Ka Tila was at the post office with five other family members.\n\n\u201cThe officials interviewed us for three hours. They asked me about my parents, I showed their death certificates. They also wanted to see the identity documents of my parents. They asked how we came here, what do I do and if we will ever go back to Pakistan. They asked several questions to each family member,\u201d said Mr. Advani. He said he was grateful to the Narendra Modi government for having implemented the CAA as before this he had never applied for citizenship under the Citizenship Act, 1955.\n\n\u201cThat process involved lot of paperwork. CAA makes it easy for us. People who applied under Citizenship Act, 1955, their files were pending for years. This time I am hopeful that after an enquiry is done by a security official, I will get citizenship soon,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Advani\u2019s daughter, Arti, was eight years old when she came to India on a pilgrim visa. Today, she is married with three children, the youngest of them a six-month-old boy.\n\n\u201cI got married in India, my husband is also from Sindh, Pakistan. He came in 2014. I have applied for citizenship through my father. My husband will apply later and am sure he will get it,\u201d said Arti adding that she never went to school in Pakistan but studied till Class VII after coming here.\n\nIn a first, the government has entrusted officials from Census, postal department, railways and National Informatics Centre to scrutinise and verify the documents after they are submitted online. An empowered committee under Directorate of Census is the final authority to grant citizenship. The Senior Superintendent or Superintendent of Post heads the district-level committee where an official not below the rank of Naib Tehsildar or equivalent from the office of District Collector representing the State government is only an invitee.\n\nAs CAA was opposed by many States including West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, in order to bypass the role of the State government in implementing the law, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) notified committees headed by Census and postal department officials leaving no scope for the involvement of State governments.\n\nCitizenship is a subject under the Union List of the Constitution and the State\u2019s role could have come in play in providing logistics such as office space and police verification of applicants. In the past, MHA has delegated powers to District Magistrates to confer citizenship in certain cases.\n\n\u201cSince post offices and railways have a presence even at the micro-level in the country, it was decided to use the infrastructure to implement CAA. Instead of police, the character and security verification of applicants is being done by the Intelligence Bureau,\u201d said a senior government official.\n\nCAA facilitates citizenship to undocumented migrants belonging to six non-Muslim communities \u2014 Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, who entered India on or before December 31, 2014, and reduces the period to qualify for citizenship from existing 11 years to five years. CAA says the minorities from the three neighbouring countries who entered India without any passport, visa through illegal means \u201cshall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act,\u201d and will be exempted from the punishable sections under Section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and the Foreigners Act, 1946. Insertion of Section 6B paves the way for such migrants to get citizenship by registration and naturalisation.",

The meeting was convened under the banner of Karnataka Rajya Janapara Chalavaligala Okkoota. Representatives of women, Dalit, farmers\u2019 and workers\u2019 organisations attended the meeting.\n\nThe participants expressed anger over the delay in arresting the accused and demanded that the State government protect the survivors of the alleged sexual abuse.\n\nRoopa Hassan, poet and activist, said the victims have not been able to come out of the trauma. \u201cMen with political interests are making use of the women as pawns in their game,\u201d she alleged.\n\nSenior advocate B.T.

Venkatesh said the murders reported in Hubballi were \u201calarming\u201d but, associating them with the government was not a healthy practice, he said in a statement here.\n\n\u201cSuch unfortunate incidents may take place due to personal reasons, vindictiveness, desperation, criminal background, and other psychological and socio-economic reasons. But, generalising such incidents and pointing a finger at the Home Department for these incidents shows their mean mentality,\u201d Mr. Venkatesh said in a statement here.\n\nClaiming that the Congress government in the State was handling law and order efficiently, Mr. Venkatesh cited the example of peaceful polling during both phases of elections in Karnataka.\n\nHe said the BJP cannot appreciate the pro-people governance of the Congress in Karnataka as it portrays the unconstitutional bulldozing of houses of Dalits, oppressed, and minorities as examples of good governance. \u201cHence, such accusations of BJP have no value,\u201d he said.\n\nThough hundreds of such criminal incidents had taken place during the BJP rule, the Congress leaders will not make political capital out of such incidents, he said.\n\nPointing out that the Congress party had successfully implemented five guarantee schemes as promised before the elections, Mr. Venkatesh said the poor people, who were suffering from the price rise under the \u201crepressive\u201d regime of the BJP government at the Centre, found the guarantee schemes like Shakti, Gruha Lakshmi, Gruha Jyothi, Anna Bhagya, and Yuva Nidhi to be a welcome \u201crelief\u201d.\n\nWhile Gruha Lakshmi, which entitles each women head of poor families \u20b92,000 every month, is arguably the world\u2019s largest Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme, Mr. Venkatesh pointed out that economic activities had been spurred after a large number of women began visiting religious centres and tourist centres availing of the benefit of free travel under Shakti.\n\nHe appealed to the BJP and JD(S) leaders to stop looking at the situation with \u201cjaundice\u201d eyes and honestly review the work of the State government, which is committed to a pro-people governance.",

        "title": "The value of attributing extreme events to climate change | Explained",
        "publish_date": "2024-05-18",
        "text": "Just a couple of decades ago, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) argued that individual weather events could not be attributed to climate change. The science has since evolved, albeit with all its attendant uncertainties, and now we regularly hear of researchers having been able to attribute some individual extreme events to climate change.\n\nMany scientific and data challenges persist in this exercise even as its outcomes are argued to be usable for estimating richer countries\u2019 historic liability of climate-related \u2018loss and damage\u2019 and the legal liability of governments and corporations in precipitating adverse events like floods and droughts. However, researchers have used a variety of methods to evaluate attributability, which raises questions about whether attribution science is mature enough to be used in courts and multilateral fora.\n\nWhat is the value of extreme-event attribution?\n\nWhile no formal cost-benefit analysis of an attribution exercise has been reported, many experts have argued that attributions are critical for the \u2018loss and damage\u2019 (L&D) process. L&D doesn\u2019t have a unique definition but its place in climate talks under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change has come a long way in the last decade. Economically developing countries, in particular those that are \u2018particularly vulnerable\u2019, have demanded the L&D fund to pay for the havoc climate change wreaks within their borders. Obviously, the criteria by which \u2018particularly vulnerable\u2019 countries are to be identified are crucial.\n\nFor example, India is a developing country in the tropics and is highly vulnerable to climate change\u2019s impacts. But it is unlikely that India will qualify for L&D funding, and herein lies the rub: should climate finance and green funds focus on adaptation and mitigation alone or should they administer L&D funds separately? If the latter, then will attribution exercises help? The developed world is opposed to the idea of being held legally accountable in a court for any extreme events since that could open a floodgate of lawsuits.\n\nAgainst this background, our understanding of whether attribution reports can actually hold up in court as evidence of culpability is very important. A good case in point is a recently published report on heatwaves in Asia.\n\nHow were the Asian heatwaves attributed?\n\nLast week, a team of climate scientists called World Weather Attribution (WWA) reported that heatwaves across Asia, from the west to the southeast, had been rendered nearly 45-times more likely by climate change.\n\nIt is worth understanding how these \u2018rapid extreme event attributions\u2019 are performed. The most important concept is the change in probability: in this case, the climate scientists contrasted the conditions in which the heatwaves occurred against a counterfactual world in which climate change did not happen. The conditions that prevail in the counterfactual world depend on the availability of data from our world. When there isn\u2019t enough data, the researchers run models for the planet\u2019s climate without increasing greenhouse gas emissions and other anthropogenic forcings. Where there was sufficient data, they use trends in the data to compare conditions today with a period from the past in which human effects on the planet were relatively minimal.\n\nThis said, the data are hardly ever sufficient, especially for rainfall, and almost never for extreme rainfall events. Climate models are also notoriously bad at properly capturing normal rainfall and worse at extreme ones. Thus, climate scientists need to address these challenges in the process of assigning probability changes to events in the past. The climate models are better at capturing temperatures and temperature-related events \u2014 but again, only at regional scales, not at very local scales.\n\nIf, some day, climate scientists are able to perform reliable hyperlocal attribution exercises, they will still be confronted by a moral question: what actions should follow? Because right now, even though the L&D fund and climate jurisprudence are becoming more visible, attribution exercises are happening as if disconnected from governments\u2019 adaptation and mitigation strategies.\n\nPut another way: will people and businesses move away if a place is seen as being a hotspot of extreme events? This is not just a question of science. Governments need to be able to respond to such decisions, and attribution science should in turn be sufficiently reliable.\n\nHow do scientists pick extreme events to attribute?\n\nAnother significant challenge in attribution exercises is how scientists choose the extreme events for which they will perform attribution exercises.\n\nWhen evaluating the Asian heatwaves, the WWA scientists used regional scales and different definitions for different regions. They also arbitrarily considered daily, three-day or monthly average temperatures for attributing likelihoods.\n\nHeatwaves can be exacerbated by natural factors such as an El Ni\u00f1o event or human factors like urbanisation and deforestation. There is also a debate as to whether irrigation affects heatwaves as well.\n\nFurther, no weather event will occur in exactly the same form twice in a place, which means an extreme event occurring in that place will likely have no precedent. This is why it is easier to reliably attribute heatwaves at the subcontinent scale but not those at the level of particular areas.\n\nThe kind of questions that climate scientists ask also matters. For example, the same analysis can produce different answers to the questions \u201cwas the intensity of a heatwave amplified by climate change?\u201d and \u201cwas the frequency or return period of a heatwave altered by climate change?\u201d. In the WWA report, the scientists used multiple approaches in their attribution exercise to answer the same question, and have added that the differences between them are immaterial. It is not clear whether these differences will be perceived to be material in a court of law.\n\nHow do extreme events depend on human action?\n\nThe actual impacts of extreme events depend not only on the hazard or the extreme event but also on the vulnerability and the exposure of the population affected. Similarly, the financial consequences are also affected by multiple factors. So, should an attribution exercise only focus on the hazard or should it consider the impacts as well?\n\nThis is not a trivial question, especially if L&D negotiations are to be served reliably by attributions.\n\nConsidering all these challenges, we must take stock of the international finance aspects of adaptation, mitigation, and L&D. In particular, governments should consider an agreement on historical responsibilities to fund developing countries and close adaptation gaps, build adaptation capacity, and finance mitigation for the global good.\n\nThe real world is severely resource-constrained. In a counterfactual world, where human, financial, and computational resources are infinite, attribution exercises are a beautiful scientific challenge and could serve as a productive intellectual exercise. But in the real world, we need a cost-benefit analysis based on a clear role for attribution in the overall climate action landscape.\n\nThe author is visiting professor, IIT Bombay, and emeritus professor, University of Maryland.",

        "text": "Narayanan Vaghul, the legendary Indian banker and founder-chairman of ICICI Ltd passed away in Chennai on May 18 due to age-related ailments. He was 88.\n\nMr Vaghul is survived by his wife Mrs Padma Vaghul, children Mohan & Sudha, and grandchildren Sanjay, Kavya, Anuv and Santosh. He was admitted to Chennai\u2019s Apollo Hospital\u2019s multidisciplinary critical care unit in the wee hours of the morning, and was declared dead at 12.38 p.m.\n\nNarayanan Vaghul was born in the pre-independence era in 1936 in rural south India. His family moved to Chennai (then Madras) where he studied at the famous Loyola College. Banking was not Mr Vaghul\u2019s first choice as a career. He initially wanted to join the civil services but did not make the cut in his first attempt. However, he cleared the examination to enter the newly formed State Bank of India (SBI), which he later remarked, he had attempted as a \u201cpractice test.\u201d His father then nudged him to take up the SBI job and he joined the bank in 1955.\n\nHe later quit SBI due to intense political pressure. He was described as uncompromising and honest to the core.\n\nAt SBI he was introduced to ace banker R.K. Talwar who shaped his life and banking career. After SBI he joined the National Institute of Bank Management where he subsequently became its Director.\n\nAt the age of 39 he ascended to great heights when he was offered the position of Executive Director at Central Bank of India. Then he moved on to the Bank of India as its Chairman & Managing Director in 1981. At the age of 44, he was the youngest Chairman of any public sector bank.\n\nBetween 1981 and 1985 is when he headed the development bank ICICI Ltd. as its Chairman & CEO. It was under him that ICICI Ltd transformed from a development bank to India\u2019s second largest private sector commercial bank.\n\nHe also wrote for The Hindu on economic issues.\n\nCongress\u2019 spokesperson Jairam Ramesh condoled Mr. Vaghul\u2019s passing saying that he will be remembered most for his impactful tenure at ICICI. \u201cHe played a crucial role in the financial sector reforms initiated by Dr. Manmohan Singh as Finance Minister in late 1991,\u201d Mr. Ramesh added.\n\nN. Vaghul, one of India's most distinguished bankers, has just passed away. He left his indelible mark both on public sector and private sector institutions, and will be remembered most for his impactful tenure at ICICI. He played a crucial role in the financial sector reforms\u2026 \u2014 Jairam Ramesh (@Jairam_Ramesh) May 18, 2024\n\nA new era of Indian banking\n\nMr Vaghul is credited with laying the foundation of a new era in Indian banking through the creation of Universal Banking model to cater to the needs of varied segments of customers. It was he who introduced the concept of credit rating in India and established CRISIL in 1987.\n\nHe mentored numerous professional who dominated the banking landscape for decades. These include K.V. Kamath, Kalpana Morparia, Shikha Sharma, Renuka Ramnath to name a few. It was he who brought in, and aggressively promoted, gender neutral hiring at ICICI, a practice which was later adopted by the banking sector as well as the corporate sector in general.\n\nDuring his stint at ICICI many women leaders in banking were elevated who later joined other banks at the helm.\n\nHe was honoured with numerous awards including the Padma Bhushan for his contribution to the banking and economy sector of India.\n\nHis honesty and principles can be gauged from this excerpt from his book \u2018Reflections\u2019 which was released by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Mumbai, a few months back: \u201cFairly early in my career, when I was working at SBI, I had gone to the Mumbai train station at around 5 am to receive my wife and two children. They were arriving from Chennai after a difficult journey of well over 36 hours. A ticket examiner asked me to produce the tickets. When my wife did, he remarked that we had a half ticket for my daughter, who according to him, appeared to be older than 12. When I pointed out that she was only 10, he asked me to produce the birth certificate, which he obviously knew I did not have with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe kept arguing and my wife was getting impatient after the long journey, the porter who was carrying the luggage nudged me to pay Rs 20 to settle the matter. I decided instead to pay the penalty which was double the fare.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told the ticket examiner that I would collect my refund from the railway by producing the birth certificate. I had to make half a dozen trips to the railway headquarters and ultimately got a refund of around Rs 60.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile leaving the office after collecting the cheque, I heard them clearly remarking that this was the first time he had come across a fool who would spend so much money to collect such a small refund when he could have settled the matter on the spot for a small sum. I nevertheless felt a sense of pride in sticking to my principles.\u201d\n\nThis is who Mr Vaghul was.\n\nICICI\u2019s tribute to Narayan Vaghul\n\nIn a tribute to Mr. Vaghul, ICICI bank in a post on X said, \u201cA Dharma yogi, institution builder, Guru, visionary, author, philanthropist, and doyen of Indian industry. A legendary banker who transformed ICICI from a development bank to a universal banking group covering commercial banking, insurance, investment banking, mutual funds, and more. A visionary leader who was instrumental in setting up many pioneering financial institutions. A Guru who mentored generations of leaders across banks, corporates, and educational institutions. We, the ICICI family, will forever remain grateful to you, Sir.\u201d",

The Special Court for Elected Representatives issued the warrant on a plea on Saturday by the Special Investigation Team (SIT).\n\nAccused of multiple instances of sexual abuse, Mr. Prajwal Revanna flew out of the country to Germany in the wee hours of April 27.

Both sides agreed to continue discussions for early implementation of the Agreement, it said.\n\n\"India Middle East Europe Corridor (IMEEC) takes shape with the 1st visit of an Indian Inter-Ministerial Delegation to the UAE for the India-UAE Intergovernmental Framework Agreement on IMEEC.

        "text": "The Plus One higher secondary seat issue reared its head at a meeting of worker, youth, and women\u2019s organisations convened by Minister for General Education V. Sivankutty in connection with school reopening here on Saturday.\n\nIt was the Muslim Students\u2019 Federation (MSF) that raised the issue of shortage of Plus One seats in Malabar at the meeting. The discontent over the seat shortage was driven home by MSF State secretary Noufal who protested by holding aloft a white t-shirt with the message \u201845,530 seats are Malabar\u2019s right...Malabar is a part of Kerala.\u2019\n\nMr. Noufal stressed that he was highlighting students\u2019 problems in connection with Plus One admission. He was evicted from the hall where the meeting was under way. He continued his protest outside, following which the Cantonment police arrested him and removed him from the spot.\n\nMinister for General Education V. Sivankutty alleged that the protest was a political stunt. Like last year, the government would provide opportunities for all students who had passed SSLC examinations and wanted to join Plus One to get admission, the Minister said.\n\nThe issue of Plus One seat shortage in Malabar has been simmering ever since the declaration of SSLC results. The seat shortage is said to be especially acute in Malappuram district. The government has announced marginal seat increase, but various forums are seeking additional batches, instead of increasing the number of seats in a batch in Malabar.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister informed the meeting that cleanliness day would be observed in schools on May 25. All organisations should become part of the cleanliness drive. School surroundings, classrooms, toilets, and other common spaces should all be cleaned. Pre-monsoon cleaning should also be done. With schools closed, there was a possibility that insects and reptiles had entered the premises. Such places should be closely inspected to ensure they were safe for students.",

The machines will be used to remove the silt and waste that gets collected in the canals and drains so as to ensure free flow of stormwater.\n\nAccording to the office of the Minister for Local Self-Governments M.B. Rajesh, the tender proceedings for the purchase of a jetting-cum-suction machine are currently in progress, and it is expected to be procured by July. The machine can be used to clean drains for a considerable distance without opening the slabs. It was tested in Kochi, where it aided in reducing flooding in some areas.\n\nThe Minister had held discussions with the Managing Director of the Cochin International Airport Limited for the use of the methods used in cleaning and flood control at the Airport in Thiruvananthapuram city until the suction machine become available. The slit pusher and slot trapper are being introduced as part of this.\n\nThe jetting-cum-suction machine, proposed to be bought under the Smart City project of the city Corporation would have a capacity of 11,000 litres and costs around \u20b95 crore. The jetting mechanism will be used to pump water at high pressure inside the drains using a 30 metre-long hose. The dislodged waste would be removed using the sucking machine. The vehicle would have a capacity to store 2000 litres of water for the functioning of the jetter and to collect as much as 9000 litres of waste.\n\nThe silt and waste that has got collected in the Amayizhanjan canal, Kariyil canal, Pattom canal, Thettiyar and Karamana River over the years prevents free flow of rainwater, leading to flooding in many areas across its course.",

        "text": "Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI) State vice-president K. Subhash Chandra Bose on Saturday hoped that the new government would look into the issues of the construction industry, which has been facing multiple challenges in the last few years. He said that the revival of the construction industry was the need of the hour to create employment opportunities at the local level, as well as the generation of economic activity and tax revenue to the exchequer.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu, he said that stamp duty needed to be reduced to 5 percent from 7.5 percent since it had become a big burden for the buyers, as they were being forced to spend nearly \u20b94 lakh for the registration of flats, each worth \u20b950 lakh.\n\nHe said that the builders were unable to reduce the cost of the construction as cement prices had gone up to \u20b9350 per bag, with cement coming under the 28 percent Goods and Services Tax (GST) slab. He said that steel was available at price close to \u20b970,000 per tonne and a load of sand in lorry cost nearly \u20b940,000.\n\nAccording to Mr. Bose, the cost of electrical, plumbing and other materials\u2019 had increased sharply in four years. The square feet (sq. ft) cost which was around \u20b92,800 has gone up to \u20b94,000 to \u20b94,500 in cities such as Vizianagaram. Many builders stopped construction activity as buyers are not coming forward to purchase flats at higher rates.\n\n\u201cThe new government which will be formed in the first week of June has to come out with a policy to revive the construction industry. Its restart is the need of the hour for the benefit of many industries which are dependent on construction activity. Generation of employment and economic activity are possible when the government considers our proposals,\u201d said Mr. Bose, who is also the managing director of Pride Developers.\n\nHe hoped that the new Chief Minister and concerned Ministers would hold a meeting with all stakeholders and representatives of CREDAI to resolve the issues of the industry.",

        "text": "Women who had controlling husbands and had experienced intimate partner violence in their married life are more at risk of developing sexually transmitted infection (STI) or reproductive tract infection (RTI) than women who do not report facing control or intimate partner violence (IPV) in their marriage, a new study reveals.\n\nThe study analyses data obtained from a sample size of 73,895 women in National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-2021) and was conducted by researchers in School of Health Systems Studies in Mumbai-based Tata Institute of Social Sciences and Centre for Study of Regional Development in JNU.\n\nOne in nearly every twelve married women in the age group of 15-49 years in India had experienced at least one sexually transmitted infection or reproductive tract infection over a period of one year, the study states.\n\nTo gauge if women had experienced STI/RTI, those who reported being sexually active, were asked whether they had a disease through sexual contact, a bad-smelling abnormal genital discharge, and a genital sore or ulcer in the last 12 months preceding the survey.\n\nThe study analyses in detail questions posed to women in NFHS-5 pertaining to sexual autonomy \u2014 if a wife knows her husband has a sexually transmitted disease, is she justified in asking use of a condom when they have sex; if a wife knows her husband has sex with other women, is she justified in refusing to have sex with him; and can a wife say no to her husband when she does not want to have sexual intercourse with him.\n\nThe study reveals that a majority \u2014 73% women of the total sample size claimed that they had sexual autonomy. A third of the same sample size (31%) had faced intimate partner violence be it physical which included husband pushing the wife, kicking her, dragging or punching her and so on, sexual which includes husband forcing wife to have sex with him or emotional where husband has humiliated or threatened to hurt the wife or someone close to her or insulted her. Also, 46% of the same sample size said that they faced controlling attitudes of their husbands, which included husband being jealous if wife talked to other men, frequently accusing wife of being unfaithful, not permitting wife from meeting female friends, trying to limit wife\u2019s contact with her core family, insisting on knowing where she is at all times, and not trusting her with money.\n\n\u201cThe study reveals that STI/RTI infection was substantially higher among women who experienced intimate partner violence (18.4%) as compared to those women who did not (9.7%). Also 15.9% women who face controlling attitudes of the husband also reported STI/RTI as compared to 9.4% women who reported STI/RTI but had not faced control from husband,\u201d said Pintu Paul, co-author of the study.\n\nWomen who had no sexual autonomy and were exposed to intimate partner violence were 2.3 times more likely to have STI/RTI than those who had sexual autonomy and were not exposed to intimate partner violence. Similarly, women without sexual autonomy and whose husbands endorsed controlling attitudes were over twice more likely to be exposed to RTI than those who had sexual autonomy and had not experienced their husband\u2019s controlling attitudes.\n\nMr. Paul further said, women who had sexual autonomy and freedom of physical mobility were 24% less likely to experience RTI compared to those who did not. Women\u2019s freedom of movement is measured by their ability to go to the market, the health centre and places outside the village or community.\n\nHowever, the influence of household decision-making was found to be greater than physical mobility in reducing the risk of RTI among women. \u201cWomen who had sexual autonomy and decision-making autonomy had a 36% decreased likelihood of having RTI infection than those who had not,\u201d Mr. Paul emphasised. A woman\u2019s household decision-making ability is assessed in terms of whether she can take decisions about her own health care, make large purchases for the household and visit family or relatives.\n\nMr. Paul also said, \u201cAfter controlling for sociodemographic factors in the full model, women with sexual autonomy were associated with a 12% lower likelihood of having STI/RTI than those without sexual autonomy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis may be because sexually autonomous women may have greater self-efficacy and bargaining power in their marital relationships, enabling them to make decisions about their sexual and reproductive health,\u201d the study states.\n\nAlso, the prevalence of STI/RTI was higher among younger women aged 15 to 24 years (13%) and 25 to 34 years (13.2%) as compared to older women aged 35 to 49years (11.6%).\n\n\u201cOur findings call for policy-level interventions to prevent child marriage and domestic violence against women and change regressive social norms that curb women\u2019s decision-making ability and freedom of movement,\u201d Mr. Paul added.",

Revanth Reddy has not done anything specific to claim any scheme as its flagship programme.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Hyderabad on Saturday, senior leader of the party B. Vinod Kumar said the initial assessment of any Government would be done based on its performance during the first six months. Stating that Rythu Bandhu/Bharosa was a capital investment support scheme introduced by the previous Government led by K. Chandrasekhar Rao, he suggested the Congress Government to disburse the support of \u20b97,500 per acre in the first week of June so that it could assure the farming community.\n\nHe pointed out that the Revanth Reddy\u2019s Government had given investment support to most farmers during the harvesting period of Rabi crops and suggested the Government not repeat it for the ensuing Kharif season and disburse the benefit during the \u2018Rohini Karthi\u2019 when early showers occur before monsoon season to enable farmers to take up tilling and other preparatory work.\n\nSpeaking along with party leaders Tula Uma, Gattu Ramachandra Rao, M. Sreenivas Reddy and others, Mr. Vinod Kumar demanded that the Government pay a bonus of \u20b9500 per quintal to paddy from the current Rabi season itself as the State Government had escaped its responsibility to pay it for the previous Kharif season because it had come to power during that season.\n\nHe explained that the farmers would mostly raise common (\u2018doddu\u2019) varieties of paddy in the Rabi season as the percentage of broken rice would be higher and they would raise Grade \u2018A\u2019 (\u2018sanna\u2019) varieties mostly in the Kharif season. He urged the Government to give subsidy to all varieties and not just Grade \u2018A\u2019 varieties as being planned.\n\nFurther, he asked the Government to procure the rain-soaked paddy swiftly and send them to mills for early processing to limit the damage.",

        "text": "New divisions have emerged among Israel's leaders over post-war Gaza's governance, with an unexpected Hamas fightback in parts of the Palestinian territory piling pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe Israeli Army has been battling Hamas militants across Gaza for more than seven months while also exchanging near-daily fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah forces along the northern border with Lebanon.\n\nBut after Hamas fighters regrouped in northern Gaza, where Israel previously said the group had been neutralised, broad splits emerged in the Israeli war cabinet in recent days.\n\nMr. Netanyahu came under personal attack from Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for failing to rule out an Israeli government in Gaza after the war.\n\nThe Israeli Premier's outright rejection of post-war Palestinian leadership in Gaza has broken a rift among top politicians wide open and frustrated relations with top ally the United States.\n\nExperts say the lack of clarity only serves to benefit Hamas, whose leader has insisted no new authority can be established in the territory without its involvement.\n\n\"Without an alternative to fill the vacuum, Hamas will continue to grow,\" International Crisis Group analyst Mairav Zonszein said.\n\nEmmanuel Navon, a lecturer at Tel Aviv University, echoed this sentiment.\n\n\"If only Hamas is left in Gaza, of course they are going to appear here and there and the Israeli Army will be forced to chase them around,\" Mr. Navon said.\n\n\"Either you establish an Israeli military government or an Arab-led government.\"\n\nU.S. pressure\n\nMr. Gallant said in a televised address on Wednesday: \"I call on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to make a decision and declare that Israel will not establish civilian control over the Gaza strip.\"\n\nThe Premier's war planning also came under recent attack by Army chief Herzi Halevi as well as top Shin Bet security agency officials, according to Israeli media reports.\n\nMr. Netanyahu is also under pressure from Washington to swiftly bring an end to the conflict and avoid being mired in a long counterinsurgency campaign.\n\nWashington has previously called for a \"revitalised\" form of the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza after the war.\n\nBut Mr. Netanyahu has rejected any role for the PA in post-war Gaza, saying on Thursday that it \"supports terror, educates terror, finances terror\".\n\nInstead, Mr. Netanyahu has clung to his steadfast aim of \"eliminating\" Hamas, asserting that \"there's no alternative to military victory\".\n\nExperts say confidence in Mr. Netanyahu is running thin.\n\n\"With Gallant's criticism of Netanyahu's failure to plan for the day after in terms of governing Gaza, some real fissures are beginning to emerge in the Israeli war cabinet,\" Colin P. Clarke, director of policy and research at the Soufan Group think tank, wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"I'm not sure I know of many people, including the most ardent Israel supporters, who have confidence in Bibi,\" he said, using Netanyahu's nickname.\n\nHostage 'impasse'\n\nThe Gaza war broke out after Hamas's attack on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.\n\nThe militants also seized about 250 hostages, 125 of whom Israel estimates remain in Gaza, including 37 the military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's military retaliation has killed at least 35,386 people, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry, and an Israeli siege has brought dire food shortages and the threat of famine.\n\nMany Israelis supported Netanyahu's blunt goals to seek revenge on Hamas in the aftermath of the October 7 attack.\n\nBut now, hopes have faded for the return of the hostages and patience in Netanyahu may be running out, experts said.\n\nOn Friday, the army announced it had recovered bodies of three hostages who were killed during the October 7 attack.\n\nAfter Israeli forces entered the far southern city of Rafah, where more than a million displaced Gazans were sheltering, talks mediated by Egypt, the United States and Qatar to release the hostages have ground to a standstill.\n\n\"The hostage deal is at a total impasse \u2014 you can no longer provide the appearance of progress,\" said Zonszein of the International Crisis Group.\n\n\"Plus the breakdown with the U.S. and the fact that Egypt has refused to pass aid through Rafah \u2014 all those things are coming to a head.\"",

The bloc\u2019s executive arm further said that these systems could reinforce the so-called \u201crabbit hole\u201d effect that leads users to watch increasingly disturbing content.\n\nAs part of the probe, the commission will look into Meta\u2019s use of age verification tools to prevent children under the age of 13 from accessing Facebook and Instagram. And also find out whether the company is complying with the bloc\u2019s Digital Service Act (DSA) and enforcing a high level of privacy, safety and security for minors.\n\nWhat led to the investigation?\n\nThe bloc\u2019s DSA came into effect in February. It stipulates very large online platforms, which have over 45 million users in the EU, to provide an option in their recommender systems that is not based on user profiling and share their data with the Commission and national authorities to assess compliance under the law.\n\nThe platforms are also required to take measures to protect minors from content that may impair their physical, mental or moral development. Additionally, platforms must take targeted measures to protect the rights of minors, including age verification and parental control tools that are aimed at helping minors signal abuse or obtain support.\n\nFacebook and Instagram have more than the stipulated number of users, and so are designated as very large platforms, bringing them under the law\u2019s purview.\n\nWhat is the investigation\u2019s trajectory?\n\nThe EU regulator will now carry out an in-depth investigation as a \u201cmatter of priority\u201d and gather evidence by sending additional requests for information, conducting interviews and inspections\n\nAdditionally, the commission can also accept commitments made by Meta to remedy the issues raised during the investigation.\n\nWhat has Meta done to protect children on its platforms?\n\nEarlier this year, Meta announced it was testing an AI-driven \u201cnudity protection\u201d tool that would find and blur images containing nudity that were sent to minors on the app\u2019s messaging system.\n\nAdditionally, the company said it would roll out measures to protect users under 18 years of age by tightening content restrictions and boosting parental supervision tools\n\nIs this the only investigation against Meta in the EU?\n\nThis is not the only investigation Meta\u2019s platforms are facing in the EU. In April, the regulator opened an investigation, accusing Meta of having failed to tackle deceptive advertising and disinformation in the run-up to the European Parliament elections.\n\nThe antitrust regulator\u2019s move against Meta stemmed from the platform being used as a potential source of disinformation by Russia, China and Iran to influence voters in EU.\n\nWhat about outside the EU?\n\nEven before the DSA was implemented in the EU, Meta\u2019s Instagram faced backlash in the U.S. after a report by the Wall Street Journal, published in June 2023, said the platform \u201chelps connect and promote a vast network of accounts openly devoted to the commission and purchase of under age sex content\u201d.\n\nAt the time, the company said it was working on \u201cimproving internal controls\u201d, and that it had eliminated 27 pedophile networks in addition to removing 490,000 accounts that breached its kid safety regulations in just one month.\n\nWhat are the general practices of protecting minors online?\n\nWith children growing up in an increasingly digital world, it has become increasingly difficult for parents and caregivers to ensure their online safety.\n\nParents are advised to ensure they are up to date with online risks and have set up safeguards to protect their child\u2019s digital experience. These could include setting up of kid\u2019s profiles, choosing age-appropriate apps and games and setting up child-friendly sites and search engines, and ensuring age restricted content is inaccessible on the devices and platforms they are using. Parents are also advised to supervise and spend time with their children online to ensure they do not engage in harmful activities or fall prey to online predators.\n\nAnd minors using social media platforms must ensure they know how to report and \u201cblock\u201d accounts with offensive material and foster open conversations to ensure an adult is available if something doesn\u2019t feel right.",
