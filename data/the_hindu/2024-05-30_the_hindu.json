            "publish_date": "2024-05-30",
            "text": "The African National Congress appeared on course to lose the parliamentary majority it has held for 30 years, partial results from South Africa's national election showed, in what would be the most dramatic political shift since the end of apartheid.\n\nWith results from 10% of polling stations, the ANC\u2019s share of the vote on May 29th\u2019s election stood at 42.3%, with the pro-business Democratic Alliance (DA) at 26.3% and the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) at 8.1%, data from the electoral commission showed.\n\nIf the final results were to resemble the early picture, the ANC would be forced to make a deal with one or more other parties to govern\u2014 a situation that could lead to unprecedented political volatility in the coming weeks or months.\n\nUnder South Africa's constitution, the newly elected National Assembly will elect the next president.\n\nWith the ANC still on course to be the largest party, its leader Cyril Ramaphosa is likely to remain as the country's president, although a poor showing could make him vulnerable to a leadership challenge from within party ranks.\n\nThe ANC has won national elections held every five years since the landmark 1994 election, which marked the end of apartheid and the ascent of Nelson Mandela as President.\n\nBut since those heady days the ANC's support has declined because of disillusionment over issues such as high unemployment and crime, frequent power blackouts and corruption.\n\nThe early results showed the ANC and the DA neck-and-neck on about 34% each in the key province of Gauteng, which includes the country's business capital Johannesburg and the sprawling townships of Soweto and Alexandra.\n\nThe Zuma factor\n\nIn KwaZulu-Natal, a populous eastern province where the major city of Durban is located, a new party led by former President Jacob Zuma, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), was performing strongly, with 41.7% of the vote versus 20.1% for the ANC.\n\nZuma was forced to quit as President in 2018 after a string of scandals and has since fallen out with the ANC leadership, leading him to throw his weight behind MK. The party, named after the ANC's armed wing from the apartheid era, appeared to be costing both the ANC and the EFF votes, especially in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nBy law, the electoral commission has seven days to declare full results, but in practice it is usually faster than that. In the last election, in 2019, voting took place on May 29 like this year and final results came on May 31\n\nThe new Parliament must convene within 14 days of final results being declared and its first act must be to elect the nation's President.\n\nThis means that if the ANC is confirmed to have lost its majority there could be two weeks of intense and complex negotiations to agree on how to form a new government.",

            "text": "When Bassem Eido steps outside his modest village house in Iraq's Sinjar district, he is reminded of the horrors that befell the majority-Yazidi region during the Islamic State group's onslaught a decade ago.\n\nThe area near the Syrian border still bears the scars of the fighting that raged there in 2014 \u2014 bullet-riddled family homes with pancaked roofs and warning signs of the lethal threat of landmines and war munitions.\n\nIt was here that the jihadists committed some of their worst atrocities, including mass executions and sexual slavery, before a fightback driven by Kurdish forces dislodged them from the town of Sinjar by the following year.\n\nA decade on, the self-declared IS caliphate across Syria and Iraq is a dark and distant memory, but the pain is raw in Mr. Eido's largely abandoned village of Solagh, 400 kilometres (250 miles) northwest of Baghdad.\n\n\"Out of 80 families, only 10 have come back,\" Mr. Eido told AFP in the desolate village which was once famed for its flourishing grape vines. \"The rest say there are ... no homes to shelter them. Why would they return?\"\n\nA walk through Solagh reveals collapsed homes overgrown with wild scrub and the rusting skeletons of destroyed plumbing systems scattered amid the dust and debris.\n\n\"How can my heart be at peace?\" said Eido, a 20-year-old Yazidi. \"There is nothing and no one that will help us forget what happened.\"\n\nAlso Read: Wrestling back Sinjar from the Islamic State\n\nAfter liberation, Mr. Eido honoured his father's wish to spend his final days at their home and agreed to move back in with him. Their house was ravaged by fire but still standing and could be rebuilt with help from an aid group.\n\nMost people cannot afford to rebuild, said Mr. Eido, and some camp in tents in the ruins of their homes. However, if large-scale reconstruction started, he predicted, \"everyone would come back\".\n\nAlso Read: Yazidis caught in \u201cpolitical football\u201d between Baghdad, Iraqi Kurds\n\n'Razed to the ground'\n\nSuch efforts have been slowed by political infighting, red tape and other structural problems in this remote region of Iraq, a country still recovering from decades of dictatorship, war and instability.\n\nMany who fled the IS moved to vast displacement camps, but the federal government this year announced a July 30 deadline to close them.\n\nBaghdad promised financial aid to returning families and has vowed to ramp up reconstruction efforts. The migration ministry said recently that hundreds had returned to their homes.\n\nHowever, more than 1,83,000 people from Sinjar remain displaced, the International Organization for Migration said in a recent report.\n\nWhile most areas have seen \"half or fewer\" of their residents come back, it said, \"13 locations have not recorded returns since 2014\".\n\nLocal official Nayef Sido said that villages \"are still razed to the ground and the majority of the people haven't received compensation.\"\n\nSome returnees are leaving again because, with no jobs, they cannot make ends meet, he added.\n\nAll of this only adds to the plight of the Yazidis, an ethnic and religious minority that suffered the brunt of IS atrocities, with thousands killed and enslaved.\n\nIn the village of Kojo, Hadla Kassem, a 40-year-old mother of three, said she lost at least 40 members of her family, including her mother, father and brother.\n\nThree years ago, she sought government compensation for her family's destroyed home, with the support of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), but to no avail.\n\nWhile she is still hoping for a monthly stipend for the loss of her relatives, she is trapped in a maze of bureaucracy like many others.\n\nAuthorities \"haven't opened all the (mass) graves, and the martyrs' files haven't been solved, and those in camps haven't returned\", Ms. Kassem said.\n\n\"We are devastated... We need a solution.\"\n\nTangled web of armed forces\n\nIn order to entice people to return, said the NRC's legal officer in Sinjar, Feermena Kheder, \"safe and habitable housing is a must, but we also need functional public infrastructure like roads, schools and government buildings\".\n\n\"Only with these foundations can we hope to rebuild our lives.\"\n\nFor now, many residents must travel hours for medical care that is not available at the city's only hospital.\n\nA local school has been turned into a base for an armed group, while an old cinema has become a military post.\n\nSinjar has long been at the centre of a paralysing struggle for control between the federal government and the autonomous Kurdistan administration based in Arbil.\n\nIn 2020, the two sides reached an agreement that included a reconstruction fund and measures to facilitate the return of displaced people. But they have so far failed to implement it.\n\nAdding to the complexities is the tangled web of armed forces operating there today.\n\nIt includes the Iraqi military, a Yazidi group affiliated with Turkey's foe the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and the Hashed al-Shaabi, a coalition of pro-Iran ex-paramilitaries now integrated into the regular army.\n\n\"All parties want more control, even blocking appointments and hindering\" reconstruction efforts, said a security official who requested anonymity.\n\nIn 2022, clashes between the army and local fighters forced thousands to flee again.\n\nHuman Rights Watch researcher Sarah Sanbar warned that \"both Baghdad and Arbil claim authority over Sinjar, but neither is taking responsibility for it\".\n\n\"Rather than focus on closing the camps, the government should invest in securing and rebuilding Sinjar to be a place people actually want to return to.\"",

It is timely for us to forge such a collaboration to take our lab leads towards more real-life solutions.\u201d\n\nAganitha co-founder and managing director Prasad Chodavarupu said the pact is a \u201cgreat example\u201d of the academia-industry collaboration needed to make a significant impact towards solving human diseases and suffering. \u201cOur multi-disciplinary research team specialises in multi-scale systems biology, quantum chemistry, and Generative AI, leveraging the virtual loop of innovation happening between deep science and deep tech, to transform global life sciences R&D,\u201d he said.\n\nCCMB\u2019s senior principal scientist Puran Singh Sijwali pointed out that controlling malaria has become a major issue due to \u201cdrug resistance, lack of broadly available vaccines, and insecticide resistance of mosquitoes. We are going to leverage Aganitha\u2019s generative AI capabilities in small molecules space for validated parasite drug targets to predict, test, and optimize potential antimalarial compounds.\u201d\n\nSimilarly for TB research, the research work is towards the structure-based discovery of small molecule inhibitors targeting essential proteins of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. \u201cWe anticipate this will lead to identification of multiple novel anti-TB therapeutic leads,\u201d said senior principal scientist Raghunand Tirumalai.\n\nFor studying neurotransmission in the central nervous system, the collaboration intends to \u201cdevelop nanobody binders targeting a class of neurotransmitter receptors or \u2018GluD1\u2019 receptors. These nanobodies might serve as precise molecular tools to modulate \u2018GluD1\u2019 receptor activity, potentially unlocking novel therapeutic avenues for neurological disorders like Alzheimer\u2019s and epilepsy,\u201d said another senior principal scientist Janesh Kumar.\n\nWith their small size and high specificity, nanobodies hold promise for targeted drug delivery and imaging applications, paving the way for tailored treatments with reduced side effects, he added.",

            "publish_date": "2024-05-30",
            "text": "Realme has unveiled the latest edition of its GT series after a gap of more than two years- the Relame GT 6T. To touch upon the USP of the phone, we can say that with features like Qualcomm Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 chipset, a 5,500mAh battery with 120W fast charging, and an LTPO AMOLED display, the new Realme GT 6T is offering a good deal in its price segment. Let\u2019s find out more!\n\nDesign\n\nThe Realme GT 6T offers a design that balances functionality with some premium touches, though it may not stand out compared to the latest Realme smartphones like the 12 Pro series. The handset features a glossy dual-tone finish, which is prone to smudges. The phone has a plastic build and sports a curved screen form factor, which enhances its visual appeal.\n\nThe rear side of the phone includes three individual rings for the cameras and the LED flash. The device is equipped with a USB Type-C port positioned between a SIM ejector tray and a speaker grille at the bottom edge. The earpiece also functions as a secondary speaker, delivering stereo audio output. The company has included an IR blaster, enabling control over compatible appliances.\n\nAt the front of the phone lies the hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera. The fingerprint sensor is placed on the screen which responds well. The Realme GT 6T is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for scratch resistance and boasts an IP65 rating for dust and water resistance, a commendable feature for a mid-range smartphone.\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\nThe overall design, including the curved front and back panels, does contribute to a premium feel. However, opinions on the aesthetics of the back panel may vary, particularly regarding the silver \u201cNano Mirror Design\u201d strip, which is prone to scratches and fingerprints.\n\nDisplay\n\nThe Realme GT 6T features a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a refresh rate of 120Hz. One of the standout features is its peak brightness of 6,000 nits. This extraordinary brightness level exceeds that of many high-end smartphones, although it is maintained only briefly to prevent display burn-in. Under regular usage, the display offers a typical brightness of 1,000 nits and can reach 1,600 nits in high brightness mode, providing clear visibility even in bright outdoor conditions.\n\nThe display has a resolution of 2780x1264, delivering sharp and detailed visuals. It comes with a touch sampling rate of up to 2500Hz, further enhancing the display\u2019s responsiveness and making it highly suitable for gaming and other intensive uses.\n\nColor performance is another strong point of the Realme GT 6T\u2019s display. It covers 100% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, offering vibrant and accurate colors. The 10-bit color depth allows the display to render 1.07 billion colors, resulting in more nuanced and lifelike images.\n\nHowever, the surprising thing with the GT 6T is that there is no mention of HDR certifications which might bother some users. But the display does come with a support of Dolby Vision.\n\nOS\n\nThe Realme GT 6T runs on Realme UI 5.0, based on Android 14. The company promises software updates for up to four years and security updates for three years, so users can expect long-term support and optimisation.\n\nProcessor\n\nThe Realme GT 6T is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 processor, built on TSMC\u2019s efficient 4nm process. This chipset features a combination of one Kryo Prime core clocked at 2.8GHz, four Kryo Gold cores at 2.6GHz, and three Kryo Silver cores at 1.9GHz, alongside an Adreno 732 GPU running at 950MHz. This configuration ensures robust performance across various applications and tasks.\n\nIn our testing, the Realme GT 6T handled demanding applications with ease, showing no signs of lag or performance issues. The Advanced Iceberg Vapor Cooling System effectively regulated the device\u2019s thermals, particularly noticeable during intensive gaming sessions with titles like BGMI, Asphalt, and Pokemon Go.\n\nBenchmark scores further underline the processor\u2019s capabilities. On Geekbench, it recorded 1816 in single-core and 4616 in multi-core tests. The CPU scores of the phone are one of the highest that we have seen recently in the mid-range segment. Moreover, the GPU score was equally impressive, as the phone recorded a figure of 8125, highlighting the power of the phone to manage high graphics demand while gaming.\n\nAdditionally, the smartphone incorporates an Independent Privacy Security Chip and Firewall System, safeguarding sensitive data such as biometrics and passwords. With memory and storage options ranging from 8GB + 128GB, 8GB + 256GB, 12GB + 256GB, and 12GB + 512GB configurations, the Realme GT 6T offers ample performance and storage capabilities, making it a strong contender in its price category. We got the higher-end variant to review which is the 12GB/512GB one.\n\nCamera\n\nUnlike other Realme phones, the camera power of the new Realme GT 6T is not its main highlight. The dual-camera configuration includes a 50MP Sony LYT600 main sensor with an f/1.88 aperture and a 1/1.953-inch outsole. This main sensor captures images at 12.5MP by default, delivering high levels of detail and vibrant color reproduction, even in challenging lighting. The camera\u2019s preference for warmer tones adds an appealing touch to photos, although the dynamic range could be broader.\n\nThe secondary camera is an 8MP ultra-wide lens with a 112-degree field of view (FoV) and an f/2.2 aperture. The wide-angle lens does a good job, though it shows a slight decline in sharpness and color accuracy compared to the main sensor. Nonetheless, it\u2019s useful for capturing wider scenes and offers a good addition to the camera\u2019s versatility.\n\nIn terms of night photography, the Realme GT 6T performs reasonably well. The main camera captures good detail in low light, maintaining color accuracy and producing satisfactory images with minimal noise. And as we always suggest for better outputs make use of the Night mode.\n\nFor selfies, the Realme GT 6T features a 32MP front camera housed in a punch-hole setup. This camera captures images with a good level of facial detailing and accurate skin tones. While there is a bit of overprocessing that can reduce some detail, the selfies remain attractive and highly shareable on social media. Portrait mode on the front camera performs admirably, with excellent edge detection and minimal warping in well-lit conditions, though performance dips slightly in low light.\n\nBattery\n\nThe Realme GT 6T packs a massive 5,500mAh battery. Such battery power means that the phone lasts a day and half quite comfortably with moderate usage. When it comes to charging, Realme has provided a 120W fast charging capability, which allows the phone to get fully charged in 35-40 minutes.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe Realme GT 6T emerges as a strong offering at the cusp of the premium segment, catering to those who prioritise performance and features over aesthetics. While its design may not redefine the boundaries of smartphone styling, the device\u2019s true strength lies in its potent internals. Powered by the robust Snapdragon 7+ Gen 3 chipset, the GT 6T ensures a smooth and lag-free experience for most users. If you are seeking a power-packed, reliable, and feature-rich premium phone without breaking the bank, then the new Realme GT 6T can be your deal. It starts at \u20b930,999 for the 8GB/128GB variant.",

            "publish_date": "2024-05-30",
            "text": "A Hong Kong court on May 30 convicted 14 pro-democracy activists in the city\u2019s biggest national security case under a law imposed by Beijing that has all but wiped out public dissent.\n\nThose who were found guilty included former lawmakers Leung Kwok-hung, Lam Cheuk-ting, Helena Wong and Raymond Chan. But the three judges approved by the government to oversee the case acquitted two former district councilors Lee Yue-shun and Lawrence Lau.\n\nThey were among 47 democracy advocates who were prosecuted in 2021 for their involvement in an unofficial primary election. Prosecutors had accused them of attempting to paralyze Hong Kong\u2019s government and topple the city\u2019s leader by securing the legislative majority necessary to indiscriminately veto budgets.\n\nThe 16 defendants were among 47 democracy advocates who were prosecuted in 2021 for their involvement in an unofficial primary election under the sweeping law. They were accused of attempting to paralyze Hong Kong\u2019s government and topple the city\u2019s leader by securing the legislative majority necessary to indiscriminately veto budgets.\n\nObservers said their subversion case will illustrate how the security law is being used to crush the political opposition following huge anti-government protests in 2019. But the Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist the law has helped bring back stability to the city and that judicial independence is being protected.\n\nWhen Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, Beijing promised to retain the city's Western-style civil liberties for 50 years. However, since the introduction of the 2020 law, Hong Kong authorities have severely limited free speech and assembly under the rubric of maintaining national security. Many activists were arrested, silenced or forced into self-exile. Dozens of civil society groups disbanded.\n\nThe prosecution of the primary case involves pro-democracy activists across the spectrum. They include legal scholar Benny Tai, former student leader Joshua Wong and a dozen former lawmakers including Leung Kwok-hung and Claudia Mo.\n\nThirty-one of them, including Tai, Wong and Mo, pleaded guilty to the charge of conspiracy to commit subversion. They have a better chance at shorter jail terms and will be sentenced at a later date.\n\nThe 16 others, including Leung, who pleaded not guilty and underwent a non-jury trial, are expected to appear in a two-day hearing starting Thursday.\n\nDozens of residents were lined up outside the police-guarded court building before 6 a.m. to secure a seat in the public gallery. Some supporters who were among the first in the line came as early as Wednesday evening.\n\nSocial worker Stanley Chang, a friend of one of the 16 defendants, said he arrived the site at 4 a.m. because he feared he could not get a seat. Mr. Chang said there were very few things supporters could do for them and that attending the hearing is a kind of company.\n\n\u201cI want to give some support for my friend and the faces I saw in news reports,\u201d he said, who is in his 30s.\n\nSL Chiu, who only gave his initials due to fear of government retribution, said the hearing marked a historic moment. To show his support, he said he had collected messages for the 47 activists from others in a sketchbook and planned to mail them if possible.\n\n\u201cHong Kongers are still here. We haven't given up. We are still with you all,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Lee Yue-shun, one of the accused, said on Facebook that Thursday was like a special graduation ceremony for him, though graduation is usually about sharing happiness with families and friends. \u201cThis perhaps best reflects the common helplessness of our generation,\" he said.\n\nThe July 2020 primary was meant to shortlist pro-democracy candidates who would then run in the official election. It drew an unexpectedly high turnout of 610,000 voters, representing over 13% of the city\u2019s registered electorate.\n\nThe pro-democracy camp at that time hoped they could secure a legislative majority, which would allow them to press for the 2019 protest demands, including greater police accountability and democratic elections for the city leader.\n\nBut the government postponed the legislative election that would have followed the primary, citing public health risks during the coronavirus pandemic. The electoral laws were later overhauled, drastically reducing the public\u2019s ability to vote and increasing the number of pro-Beijing lawmakers making decisions for the city in the legislature.\n\nBeijing also had criticized the vote as a challenge to the security law, which criminalizes secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in the city\u2019s affairs as well as terrorism.",

            "publish_date": "2024-05-30",
            "text": "The Madras High Court witnessed a fierce face-off between arrested former special Director General of Police (DGP) Rajesh Das and his estranged wife Beela Venkatesan, an IAS officer now serving as Energy Secretary to the Government of Tamil Nadu, over the issue of disconnection of electricity service connection to a bungalow situated at Thaiyur near Kelambakkam in Chengalpattu district.\n\nAppearing before Justice J. Sathya Narayana Prasad, senior counsel V. Prakash, representing the former special DGP, insisted on issuing a direction to Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) to restore the electricity supply forthwith and then take action after issuing notice to his client who had been reportedly paying the electricity bills for the property for over two decades.\n\nThe counsel said, though the land, on which the bungalow had been constructed, stood in the name of Ms. Venkatesan, the building was constructed with a housing loan that his client had obtained from a private bank and also from his personal savings. He said, on May 19, a lineman had come to the property to disconnect the electricity due to the pressure exerted by the Energy Secretary.\n\nWhen asked under what authority could the power be disrupted, the lineman came back the next day with a letter addressed by Ms. Venkatesan to the Tangedco Superintending Engineer in Chengalpattu on May 20 asking the officer to disconnect the power supply temporarily. The counsel contended that power could not be disconnected without notice to his client who was residing over there.\n\nOn the other hand, senior counsel P. Wilson, representing Ms. Venkatesan, said, the service connection had already been disconnected and therefore nothing remains to be decided in the writ petition filed by the former police officer. He also said, the service connection stood in the name of his client and therefore she was fully entitled to make a request for temporary disconnection of the power supply.\n\nMr. Wilson said that the substantial portion of the land actually belonged to Ms. Venkatesan\u2019s father and that he had settled it in her favour. In 2023, the Energy secretary had, in turn, settled the property in favour of her children and also filed a petition seeking divorce from the former special DGP who had been convicted and sentenced to three years of imprisonment for the charge of sexually harassing a woman IPS officer.\n\nClaiming that he had remained absconding for long despite having been convicted by the trial court in 2023 and the verdict having been confirmed by an appellate court too in 2024, Mr. Wilson said, Ms. Venkatesan had locked the bungalow to prevent him from taking refuge over there. However, he tresspassed into the residence and intimidated the security guard leading to his arrest on May 24, the counsel added.\n\nMr. Wilson also told the court that the former special DGP owns a flat at Nungambakkam in Chennai and also several lodges and that he could very well reside over there without interfering with the Thaiyur property.\n\nHowever, the former special DGP, in his affidavit, stated that there had been a burglary attempt in the Thaiyur bungalow and he came to know about it only when he returned from his native at around 6 pm on May 18. He claimed to have lodged a police complaint on May 19 and got it registered in the Community Service Register. After hearing both sides, Justice Prasad adjourned the matter for further hearing to June 3.",

Rama Rao opposed Telangana government\u2019s decision to exclude images of Charminar and Kakatiya Arch from the new state emblem to be launched on June 2, the State formation day, and warned of an agitation if the Government removes those two images.\n\nKTR visited Charminar in Hyderabad on Thursday along with his party legislators and senior leaders to protest the Government\u2019s decision and questioned the urgency with which the Government is going ahead to change the emblem. Are attempts to wipe out K. Chandrasekhar Rao\u2019s legacy in Telangana the only work of the Congress?, he asked attributing political motives to the whole episode.\n\nEarlier, taking to \u2018X\u2019 (formerly Twitter), KTR posted, \u201cWorld over, Charminar has been the icon/symbol of Hyderabad for centuries. When one thinks of Hyderabad, one cannot but think of Charminar which has all the qualities of a UNESCO world heritage site. Now Congress Government wants to remove the iconic Charminar from the State Logo citing frivolous reasons. What a shame!!\u201d\n\nThe former Minister warned that the BRS would take the legal recourse and also launch a people\u2019s movement against the Government\u2019s decision. He refuted the Government\u2019s argument that Kakatiya Kala Thoranam and Charminar were the signs of imperialism and said they reflect the historical and archaeological significance of the region apart from being the symbols of development and welfare.\n\nGovernment goes ahead with new emblem\n\nThe Congress government in Telangana is planning to unveil the State emblem on the State formation day which is on June 2. The Government contends that the present emblem featuring Kakatiya Arch and Charminar reflected feudalism and autocratic rule.\n\nChief Minister A. Revanth Reddy has been arguing that the Congress government wants an emblem that reflects the decades-long struggle for Telangana state. He has recently finalised the emblem along with Deputy Chief Minister Bhatti Vikramarka. The emblem is designed by artist Rudra Rajesham and will apparently include the symbols of tribal goddesses Sammakka and Sarakka, and the Nagoba festival of the tribals.\n\nThe new state song is also being finalised to be launched on June 2. Before the elections, the Chief Minister promised that \u2018Jaya Jayahe Telangana\u2019, a rage during the Telangana struggle penned by Andesri, would be the State song if the Congress came to power.\n\nThe song has become controversial after the Government decided to rope in Oscar-winning music director M.M. Keeravani with a section of the opposition leaders and artists opposing the composition by Mr. Keeravani, whose roots are in Andhra Pradesh.",

            "publish_date": "2024-05-30",
            "text": "A new study conducted by scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay), Mumbai published in NPJ Systems Biology and Applications, has shed light on the process of speciation, meaning the formation of new species, in the absence of geographic barriers. Traditionally, it is believed that speciation largely occurs when populations of a species are isolated from each other by geographical barriers such as mountains or bodies of water. This is called allopatric speciation. However, the new IIT Bombay research suggests that speciation can happen even when populations live in the same area without geographical barriers. This mode of speciation is called sympatric speciation.\n\nProfessor Supreet Saini, from Department of Chemical Engineering and DBT/Wellcome Trust (India Alliance) Fellow at IIT Bombay and the lead researcher of this study said, \u201cWhile there is ecological evidence in favour of sympatric hypothesis, there is no experimental evidence. And without a laboratory model to study sympatric speciation, it becomes difficult to understand it as a process. The motivation behind our work is to understand how the environment and the underlying genetics can lead to sympatric speciation and design biologically insightful experiments.\u201d\n\nThe researchers used a genetic-based model to investigate the factors that contribute to speciation when populations live in the same geographic area. This theoretical study focused on a population of birds using simulated data and specifically looked at how three aspects that encourage speciation, namely, disruptive selection, sexual selection, and genetic architecture play a role in driving and maintaining sympatric speciation.\n\nDisruptive speciation\n\n\u201cIn sympatric speciation, the \u201cdivide\u201d in the population can be created due to non-uniform resources present in the environment, and geography has no role to play here. This is called ecological disruptive selection,\u201d co-author Pavithra Venkataraman, PhD student and a Prime Minister\u2019s Research Fellow at IIT Bombay explained. In other words, disruptive selection is a process by which individuals with extreme traits have a higher fitness than those with intermediate traits.\n\nMs. Venkataraman added, \u201cDisruptive selection is necessary for speciation to occur in sympatry because it favours heritable differences in the population and ensures that the offsprings produced by the mating of individuals belonging to two different groups do not survive. These two factors are extremely important for maintaining biodiversity in sympatry.\u201d\n\nIn this study, the researchers focused on a physical trait of the birds - the beak size. The birds in the population had to adapt their beak size to best utilise two types of food resources, such as nuts and flower nectar. Birds with small beaks will be better at utilising resource nuts, while those with longer beaks will be more efficient at utilising flower nectar as their resource.\n\nRole of sexual selection\n\nSexual selection, on the other hand, is a type of natural selection driven by competition for mates. It can lead to the evolution of elaborate traits that are attractive to potential mates. In this study, the researchers looked at how female mating preference, based on a male\u2019s intensity of the trait (unique character), could play a role in speciation.\n\n\u201cSexual selection has been thought to be one of the main, or often, the sole driver of sympatric speciation. Essentially, it was thought that some members of the populations could evolve a \u2018bias\u2019 towards a trait like feather colour, and a difference in this bias could lead to sympatric speciation. For example, consider a bird population where there are two types of feathers \u2013 blue and red. If a bias evolves among the blue birds to only mate with their kind, sympatric speciation would occur because the red birds don\u2019t mix their genes with the blue ones,\u201d Ms. Venkataraman explained.\n\nIn other words, this could lead to populations with distinct blue and red traits.\n\n\u201cThe drawback of this hypothesis is that there is no basis for such a bias to evolve unless there is a fitness benefit. In other words, why does a blue bird mate only with a blue one, reducing its mate pool is not clear,\u201d Ms. Venkataraman said.\n\nThe researchers then incorporated the ability of the bird to utilise resources in the environment into their model. Surprisingly, the researchers found that sexual selection based on special traits did not contribute to speciation in sympatry. Instead, they found that the preference for mates based on a relevant trait that helps in utilising the environmental resources better, (this case, beak size), was the driving force behind speciation. The study also acknowledges the possibility of lower fitness of the offsprings due to sexual selection.\n\nGenetic architecture has a key role\n\nFurthermore, the researchers discovered that genetic architecture, or how genes control the trait under selection, was a crucial factor in determining the likelihood of sympatric speciation. If the genetic architecture allowed changes in beak size, then a new species could develop even with a weak role of disruptive selection.\n\nOn the limitations of the study, Professor Saini said, \u201cIn our model, we assume that birds from the two groups mate without any bias and that this bias does not change with time. This may not be true in natural populations, where a bias based on the beak size is expected to evolve. It is also possible for the birds of the two groups to evolve with distinct markers that help them distinguish their \u201ckind\u201d from the other.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, this study provides valuable insights into the conditions and mechanisms that can lead to sympatric speciation. It challenges the traditional view that speciation can only occur in geographical isolation and highlights the importance of genetic architecture and ecological selection in driving the formation of new species, said Mr. Saini.\n\n\u201cA large part of our research effort is to take lessons from theory and to design experiments for understanding how reproductive barriers evolve between members of the population in sympatry. Towards this, we work with yeast to demonstrate and establish a laboratory model to study speciation in sympatry,\u201d Mr. Saini added while indicating the path ahead.\n\nBy unravelling the mysteries of speciation, scientists are gaining a deeper understanding of the incredible diversity of life on our planet and the processes that generate it. By demonstrating how sympatric speciation can occur, even with relatively low levels of disruptive selection, the researchers have provided a framework for future experimental studies on biodiversity. This knowledge could open up new avenues for research and help scientists better understand the mechanisms behind the biodiversity on Earth. With the imminent threat of climate change, perhaps this can also shed light on the impacts of climate change on biodiversity at large, Mr. Saini said.",

Long-term investors can profit from this temporary aberration,\" he said.\n\n\u201cBesides, spike in the U.S. bond yields pushing the 10-year yield above 4.6% is a major concern,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cthis can trigger continuation of the FII selling which will depress the prices of large-caps further\u201d.

Perhaps it gives them the ability to do that quicker or to do that with more volume. But it hasn't really impacted our ability to detect them,\" said Meta head of threat investigations Mike Dvilyanski.\n\nThe report highlighted six covert influence operations that Meta disrupted in the first quarter.\n\nIn addition to the STOIC network, Meta shut down an Iran-based network focused on the Israel-Hamas conflict, although it did not identify any use of generative AI in that campaign.\n\nMeta and other tech giants have grappled with how to address potential misuse of new AI technologies, especially in elections.\n\nResearchers have found examples of image generators from companies including OpenAI and Microsoft producing photos with voting-related disinformation, despite those companies having policies against such content.\n\nThe companies have emphasized digital labeling systems to mark AI-generated content at the time of its creation, although the tools do not work on text and researchers have doubts about their effectiveness.\n\nMeta faces key tests of its defenses with elections in the European Union in early June and in the United States in November.",

            "text": "The political parties in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have fielded some of the richest politicians in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. These are the two States where the worth of the average assets of candidates in the fray is the highest. This is mainly due to the relatively rich candidates who have been fielded by the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), and the Jana Sena Party (JSP). The TDP features first on the list of the top 10 parties with the highest average assets of candidates; the JSP and BRS feature third and fourth. The Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) is eighth on the list.\n\nChandra Sekhar Pemmasani of the TDP, who is competing for the Guntur seat, is the richest in the fray with assets worth \u20b95,706 crore. The TDP\u2019s poorest candidate declared assets worth \u20b93 crore. Apart from the regional parties, even the candidates of national parties who were fielded from these States are relatively rich. The second richest in the fray, with assets worth \u20b94,568 crore, is the BJP\u2019s Konda Vishweshwar Reddy, who is competing from the Chevella seat in Telangana. The Congress candidate from Chevella, Gaddam Ranjith Reddy, with assets worth \u20b9436 crore, is also among the richest. Many other relatively rich candidates such as the BJP\u2019s C.M. Ramesh (\u20b9498 crore); the Congress\u2019 Y.S. Sharmila Reddy (\u20b9182 crore); the TDP\u2019s Prabhakar Reddy Vemireddy (\u20b9716 crore) and Sribharat Mathukumili (\u20b9299 crore); the BRS\u2019 Kasani Gyaneshwar Kasani (\u20b9228 crore), Nama Nageshwara Rao (\u20b9156 crore), and Kyama Mallesh (\u20b9145 crore); and the YSRCP\u2019s Chalamalasetty Sunil (\u20b9150 crore) and Simhadri Chandra Sekhar Rao (\u20b9139 crore) are also competing from these two States.\n\nChart 1 | The chart shows the candidate-wise average assets in \u20b9 crore.\n\nChart appears incomplete? Click to remove AMP mode\n\nChart 2 | The chart shows the party-wise average assets of candidates in \u20b9 crore.\n\nIn Charts 1 and 2, only select parties and their candidates are depicted. They have been chosen based on various parameters such as the number of candidates fielded, geography, and the party\u2019s popularity. As noted earlier, the TDP is on top of the list in terms of average assets of candidates (with its candidates having average assets of \u20b9416 crore) followed by the Janata Dal (Secular) (\u20b994 crore), the JSP (\u20b982 crore), and the BRS (\u20b954 crore). The BJP features seventh on the list with its candidates having average assets of \u20b941 crore behind the two parties which split from the Nationalist Congress Party. The parties from Tamil Nadu \u2014 the AIADMK and the DMK \u2014 feature ninth and tenth, respectively. Congress candidates feature 14th on the list with average assets of \u20b925 crore. The Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party headed by Mehabooba Mufti (\u20b91.4 crore), the CPI(M) (\u20b91.4 crore), and the BSP (\u20b92.6 crore) are at the bottom of the list.\n\nChart 3 | The chart shows the State-wise average assets of candidates in \u20b9 crore.\n\nOnly major States were considered. However, all the parties and independents were included. Candidates in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have average assets of \u20b921 crore and \u20b914 crore, respectively \u2014 the highest. Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Karnataka were the other States in the top five. Chhattisgarh (\u20b91.3 crore), J&K U.T. (\u20b92 crore) and Kerala (\u20b92.3 crore) are at the bottom of the list.\n\nNotably, the BJP\u2019s poorest candidate is Rekha Patra. She is one of the women who spearheaded the Sandeshkhali movement against Trinamool leaders. She declared assets worth \u20b925,000. While all the parties couldn\u2019t be depicted, an analysis including all candidates and independents showed that as many as 46 candidates, mostly independents, declared that they did not have any assets.\n\nAlso read: Data | MLAs in poll-bound Karnataka have average assets worth \u20b934.6 crore, highest among all States\n\nWatch our Data video: Watch | Data Point: Which State has India\u2019s richest MLAs?",

Modi ji has indulged in the most vicious form of hate speeches, which are purely divisive in nature,\u201d Dr. Singh said in three-page three-page appeal to the voters of Punjab on Thursday.\n\nPolling for the 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab is slated for June 1 during the last phase of the general election.\n\n\u201cModi ji is the first Prime Minister to lower the dignity of public discourse, and thereby the gravity of the office of the Prime Minister. No Prime Minister in the past has uttered such hateful, unparliamentary and coarse terms, meant to target either a specific section of the society or the opposition. He has also attributed some false statements to me. I have never in my life singled out one community from the other. That is the sole copyright of the BJP,\u201d he added.\n\nDr. Singh didn\u2019t mention the remark about the community in his letter. However, Mr. Modi at a public meeting in Rajasthan, claimed that Dr. Singh said (in 2006) \u201cMuslims had the first claim on the country\u2019s resources\u201d.\n\nPointing out that in the past ten years, the BJP government has left no stone unturned in castigating \u201cPunjab, Punjabis and Punjabiyat\u201d, Dr. Singh said that 750 farmers, mostly belonging to Punjab, were martyred while incessantly waiting at Delhi borders (during protests against now repealed farm laws), for months together. \u201cAs if the lathis and the rubber bullets were not enough, none less than the Prime Minister verbally assaulted our farmers by calling them \u2018Andolanjeevis\u2019 and \u2018Parjeevi\u2019 (Parasites) on the floor of the Parliament. Their only demand was the withdrawal of the three farm laws imposed on them without consulting them.\u201d he said, adding that the BJP policies have eroded the earnings of farmers.\n\nAlso Read | Modi keeps up reservation rhetoric, says Congress wants to give SC, ST quotas to people who practice \u2018vote jihad\u2019\n\nDr. Singh said the nation\u2019s economy has witnessed unimaginable turmoil during BJP\u2019s regime. \u201cThe imposition of the demonetisation disaster, a flawed GST, and the painful mismanagement during the COVID pandemic has resulted in a miserable situation...Unprecedented unemployment and unbridled inflation have greatly widened inequality, which is now at a 100-year high...the misrule of the BJP government has resulted in the depletion of household savings to a historic 47-year low\u2026 There are 30 lakh government vacancies,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the BJP government imposed an ill-conceived Agniveer Scheme on our Armed Forces. \u201cThe BJP thinks that the value of patriotism, bravery and service is only 4 years. This shows their fake nationalism. Those who trained for regular recruitment were woefully betrayed by the outgoing regime. The youth of Punjab, the son of the farmer, who dreams of serving the motherland through the Armed Forces, is now thinking twice about getting recruited only for a 4-year stint. Agniveer Scheme endangers National Security. Congress party has therefore promised to abolish the Agniveer Scheme,\u201d he said.",

            "publish_date": "2024-05-30",
            "text": "The story so far: Following a three-month forced shutdown, Haiti\u2019s main international airport in Port-au-Prince reopened, sparking hopes for shipment of essential products. However, gang violence persists in the capital, though most of the gangs\u2019 demands have been addressed. Meanwhile, after months of delay due to legal obstacles and violence, an advance team of the Kenyan special forces police landed in Haiti to combat the instability.\n\nWhat is being done for stability?\n\nAfter Prime Minister Ariel Henry\u2019s resignation on April 24, the formation of a Council with seven members was the first major development. The Council has been tasked with restoring order in Haiti, setting the agenda of a new Cabinet, forming a national security council, and appointing an electoral commission to help conduct polls. It enjoys the backing of the Caribbean countries and the U.S. Caricom, a Caribbean trade bloc which helped form the council, said that the installation of the \u201cpolitically inclusive council signals the possibility of a new beginning for Haiti.\u201d While Finance Minister Michel Patrick Boisvert was appointed as interim Prime Minister, on April 30, former Minister Fritz B\u00e9lizaire was chosen for the post by the Council.\n\nAlso Read : Haiti capital a \u2018city under siege\u2019 amid spasm of gang violence\n\nWhat is the situation at present?\n\nThough there is a Council, there is also a divide. During its first task of choosing a Prime Minister, four of the seven voting members chose Mr. B\u00e9lizaire. This decision to appoint the little-known official was taken without consulting the rest of the council or holding a formal vote. This divide has reportedly strengthened worries of the Council using its position to further its own corrupt needs, following a pattern consistent with previous political officials in Haiti.\n\nMoreover, gang violence continues. The insufficiently armed national police are still unable to counter the violence. Gang violence has become a part of daily life in Haiti over the last two decades, enabled by a weakened security apparatus, lack of effective law enforcement and widespread impunity. In the first three months of 2024, as per UN estimates, more than one person was killed due to gang violence every hour.\n\nWhy does gang violence continue?\n\nOne of the driving forces behind gang violence was the continued control exercised by Mr. Henry, and it was expected that his resignation would allow for a semblance of peace and stability. However, not only has the violence continued (though there has been a reduction), there are new concerns.\n\nIn May, UNICEF\u2019s Representative in Haiti, Bruno Maes, noted that the \u201chealth system is on the verge of collapse\u201d as it is faced with \u201cviolence, mass displacement, dangerous epidemic and increasing malnutrition.\u201d Six out of 10 hospitals that are operational in the country are barely managing to function, and the biggest problem currently is the \u201cstrangling of supply chains.\u201d About 1.6 million of the 4.4 million in Haiti face emergency levels of food insecurity, and the expected arrival of the monsoons will bring with it waterborne diseases such as cholera.\n\nWhat is next for Haiti?\n\nThere are three specific challenges for Haiti. First, the divide within the transitional Council underscores the inherently fragile political landscape of the country. A rocky start may set the tone for the rest of its decisions and the country\u2019s faith in it. Second, the persistent threat posed by armed gangs continues to loom large over Haiti, perpetuating a cycle of violence and insecurity that hampers efforts to restore law and order. Gangs have warned of more violence if they are not given a seat at the table with the Council, and if their demand for amnesty for their crimes is not granted.\n\nThird, the deployment of a UN-backed security mission, comprised of Kenyan police forces, has sparked controversy and raised concerns about potential violation of human rights. While the mission aims to bolster efforts to combat gang violence and restore stability, there are fears that it may inadvertently exacerbate tensions and contribute to human rights abuses.\n\nDhriti Mukherjee is a Research Assistant at the National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bengaluru.",

            "text": "Indian elections are always a captivating spectacle. Given that India a multi-party democracy, predicting the winnder and loser is a challenging game. However, there\u2019s no shortage of psephologists, both professional and amateurs, who indulge in this exercise.\n\nSince 1991, the results have been linked to economic programmes. As a result, stock market punters have shown greater interest than before.\n\nHaving participated in elections since 1977\u2014as an onlooker, a voter (1983), and subsequently as a market participant (1991)\u2014I\u2019ve had a ringside view of how markets behaved during the election period leading up to the formation of a new government.\n\nSince 1991, two principal forces (Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party) have ruled for most of the time, except for a brief period of 2 years during the late 1990s. While Congress was in power for 15 years, BJP has been slightly longer in power at 16 years, with the Third Front having a short stint of 2 years.\n\nLet\u2019s delve into market movements during each of the elections, beginning from 1991.\n\n1991: The prospective PM candidate, Rajiv Gandhi, was assassinated during the first phase, and the elections had to be postponed and held in two more phases. There was uncertainty all around, but the markets held steady and jumped just before the results day since they sensed a stable government would be formed. Congress was the single-largest party with 244 seats, BJP was the runner-up with 120. This government lasted its full term of 5 years, and this period saw the birth of economic liberalization.\n\n1996: While investors expected Congress to come back to power since the liberalization measures initiated by Manmohan Singh and Narasimha Rao had started yielding results, the markets indicated otherwise. Markets won yet again. The BJP was the single largest party with 161 seats, while Congress was relegated to 2nd place with 140 seats while the Third Front had around 78 seats. It was a hung parliament and it was reflected in the market moves thereafter too.\n\n1998: While investors were confused, prices had started an uptrend, hoping that BJP would emerge as the single largest party by far, which is what happened. BJP improved upon its tally and reached 182 seats while Congress had to settle for 141. This government too would collapse within 13 months since there was no majority even with allies, but the market expected good governance under BJP, hence the buoyancy.\n\n1999: Betrayed by its allies and reeling under U.S. sanctions, the country went in for polls between September and October, 1999. While investors expected a hung parliament yet again, the country chose the BJP, which, with the same number of seats but more allies, could form a stable government. Markets had sensed the possibility and had built up momentum before the government was formed and took off soon after.\n\n2004: This was a landmark election in more ways than one. The government was riding on the coattails of the \u2018India Shining\u2019 campaign, while the opposition was disgraced and weak. The economy was doing well, the PM was universally popular, hence he advanced the elections by 6 months. Opinion polls were giving NDA around 340-350 seats and the punters (including me) had built up huge long positions in anticipation of bumper profits on results day. However, the markets had a mind of their own. Since the first phase on April 20, the markets were beset with selling pressure and by the day of the results, they were falling steadily. It was a shock result. Congress was the winner albeit by a very small margin of just 7 seats while the BJP got 138 seats. But the damage was done. The markets cracked hugely, by about 16% on a single day since everyone was overleveraged and had to sell in panic. But the market had spoken before the first round itself. None of us saw it coming.\n\n2009: These elections were held soon after the Global Financial Crisis and the economy was limping back to normalcy. Investors felt we would have a hung parliament just like the 1990s since economic conditions were dismal. Yet the market was resilient going into the polls and when the results came on the weekend, it was advantage Congress with 206 seats while the BJP was second at 116 seats. The markets leapt 16% in a single day as bears ran for cover; yet again investors missed the market\u2019s signals.\n\n2014: While the challenger (Mr. Narendra Modi) was the market\u2019s favourite, there were still doubts among the punters whether the BJP would be able to pull off a majority on its own. Yet once again, the markets showed the way by being very steady leading to the various phases, then took off just before the final phase and then there was no looking back smashing many records in the process.\n\n2019: The election campaign started off on a subdued note seemingly, with the challenger (Congress) having a chance, but the Balakot incident turned the tide in favour of the BJP significantly. The momentum carried to 5 of the 7 phases. The market exhibited some nervous moments in the interim but recovered in the last phase to give a spectacular victory of 303 seats to BJP\u2014the highest-ever in 35 years.\n\n2024: This time too, we have 7 phases. The opinion polls are all unanimous that BJP alone is likely to get a minimum of 330 seats. Punters too are \u2018all in\u2019 with highly leveraged bets. No one is expecting anything less than the 303 seats which the BJP got last time. Effectively, the punters don\u2019t have a stop loss. While the Sensex, Nifty and, Bank Nifty were volatile within a range till the completion of the 5th phase, the Sensex and Nifty have suddenly perked while Bank Nifty has lagged. Note that the fiinancial sector has a weightage of around 34% in the Nifty. In the past 25 years, Bank Nifty has been a better weather vane of the direction of the markets. Interestingly even in the Nifty, of the top 25 stocks which have a combined weightage of nearly 80%, only 4 stocks hit all time highs last week, clearly indicating that the \u201csmart money\u201d is still not enamoured with the latest irrational exuberance.\n\nThe market has got it right all the time since 1991, across eight elections. The current price action suggests the market is dangerously poised for the bulls due to heavy leverage and unwillingness to consider any other alternative except the BJP winning 330+ seats. The market is telling us something else. Brace for impact on June 4th.\n\n(The writer is an independent market analyst)",

            "title": "New light-based tool could cut cost of spotting viral infections",
            "publish_date": "2024-05-30",
            "text": "Viruses infect plants, animals, and humans. A virus\u2019 spread from animals to humans could unleash pandemics like COVID-19 \u2014 significant public health crises with considerable economic and social fallout. To nip such infections in the bud, public health researchers have advocated the \u2018One Health\u2019 approach: monitoring and protecting plant, animal, environment, and human health in an integrated fashion.\n\nQuick, easy, and cost-effective methods of detecting viral infections can go a long way in ensuring this outcome. Recently, researchers from Harvard University, Cambridge, and Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, reported developing one such tool: it can detect if cells have been infected by a virus using only light and some knowledge of high-school physics.\n\nTheir paper was published in the journal Science Advances in March this year.\n\nA fingerprint of infection\n\nA viral infection can stress cells and change their shapes, sizes, and features. As the infection gains the upper hand and the body becomes \u2018diseased\u2019, the changes become more stark.\n\nThe researchers behind the new study translated these cellular changes into patterns that could be used to say if a cell had been infected. They infected cells from a pig\u2019s testicles with pseudorabies virus, shone light on them through a microscope, and tracked how changes in the cells distorted the light.\n\nThe researchers recorded these distortions at different points of time so that the light data mimicked a progressing viral infection. Then they compared these distortions with those in light that had been shone through healthy cells. They finally reported that the difference between the two light patterns represented a \u2018fingerprint\u2019 of virus-infected cells.\n\nChanges in contrast\n\nThe distortion in question referred to diffraction patterns. Diffraction is the tendency of light waves to spread out after they pass through narrow openings or around small objects. Once this diffracted light reaches, say, a wall, it renders a pattern of alternating light and dark rings or stripes around a dark centre.\n\nThe fingerprint was based on two parameters: the contrast between the light and dark stripes and the inverse differential moment, a mathematical value that defined how textured the diffraction pattern was.\n\nThe method can differentiate between uninfected, virus-infected, and dead cells. Virus-infected cells were elongated and had more clear boundaries than uninfected cells. This changed the contrast between light and dark stripes of the diffraction fingerprint, and increased the differences in light intensity.\n\nLess time, money, complexity\n\nCurrent methods to detect virus infections in cells are not straightforward. For example, in one technique, researchers isolate infected cells in the lab and add chemical reagents like dimethyl thiazolyl diphenyl tetrazolium bromide to them. The reagent destroys the cells, but not before the enzymes in the cells \u2014 called oxidoreductases and dehydrogenases \u2014 react with the reagent to produce purple crystals of a chemical entity called formazan. This colour change tells researchers the cells could have had a viral infection. Cells dying of a viral infection lack these enzymes and thus produce little to no amounts of formazan crystals.\n\nThe researchers compared their new technique with this standard for accuracy, time, and cost. They reported that their light-based method could detect viral infections as accurately or even more accurately than the standard method.\n\nThe new method was also cheaper than the standard: while the equipment cost for the standard method using chemical reagents is about $3,000 (Rs 2.5 lakh), the cost of the new method described in this paper was about a tenth. Many research facilities around the world also procure reagents from other places, adding potential time delays and vulnerability of their research to supply-chain inefficiencies.\n\nFinally, the new method reportedly takes only about two hours to detect virus infected cells, against the 40 hours the current standard required.\n\nAdvantages for livestock\n\nAccording to the paper, the researchers placed a sample of cells on slides under a microscope and light was shone on them. They obtained and subsequently analysed the diffraction fingerprint, and correlated each fingerprint with the corresponding condition of the cells. The team is yet to conduct real-world tests.\n\nThe low cost and ease of use point are likely to be lucrative to people working closely with animals, especially \u201clivestock or common pets such as dogs and cats,\u201d the researchers wrote in their paper. The new tool can help spot viral infections in their bodies as well as for \u201cthe selection and breeding of excellent livestock and poultry species at the cellular level\u201d.\n\nA new tool in the arsenal\n\nIndeed, the new method could help catch viral infections early \u2014 which could be very helpful during, say, a virulent bird flu outbreak. The one going on around the world killed more than 131 million poultry in 81 countries in 2022 and 2023, according to the World Health Organisation.\n\nScientists typically test samples from any part of the bird the virus could infect: windpipe, cloaca (the waste chamber for urine and faeces), or their waste itself. If a bird dies after displaying the symptoms associated with the infection, they also look for the pathogen in the carcass\u2019s tissues.\n\nThe methods they use include polymerase chain reaction (of the \u2018PCR\u2019 fame during the COVID-19 pandemic) or antigen tests, which detect the genes or proteins associated with the H5N1 virus. While the new method is not specific to certain kinds of viruses, it can help detect viral infections in general and help stakeholders take preventive measures in time to avoid significant losses.\n\nIn fact, the tool\u2019s generic nature could also be an advantage by catching a viral infection that is not due to H5N1, perhaps even a new virus.\n\nAgainst the spread of viruses\n\nViral outbreaks in animals have significant economic consequences. According to a 2018 study in the journal Transboundary and Emerging Diseases, bird flu outbreaks in the Kuttanad region of Kerala imposed losses of Rs 23 lakh in 2014 (2018 rate). The study also estimated the Government of Kerala spent Rs 5.4 crore \u201cto contain the disease spread through massive culling, surveillance and monitoring of poultry and humans due to [the] zoonotic nature of the disease\u201d.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, a rapid and cost-effective way to detect viral infections could help improve surveillance and reduce the cost of selecting healthy animals or birds for breeding. The existing methods to select animals for breeding require expensive DNA-sequencing tools, even if these tools are very good at identifying some desired features in an animal.\n\nThe light-based tool could also help low- and middle income countries with limited resources to realise the WHO\u2019s recommendation to \u201crapidly detect, report and respond to animal outbreaks as the first line of defence\u201d against the spread of viruses.\n\nJoel P.

            "text": "Anna University has filed a writ appeal in the Madras High Court claiming it is not in a financially sound position to deposit even 30% (\u20b973.23 lakh) of the provident fund dues of \u20b92.44 crore arrived at by a Regional Provident Fund (RPF) Commissioner in Coimbatore.\n\nWhen the appeal was listed for admission before summer vacation Bench of Justices J. Sathya Narayana Prasad and V. Lakshminarayanan, the university counsel said, the management could at best deposit only \u20b910 lakh as a pre-condition to stay the RPF Commissioner\u2019s demand.\n\nHowever, finding the offer to deposit \u20b910 lakh to be too low, the Bench simply adjourned the writ appeal to be heard, after the conclusion of the summer vacation, on June 5. It directed the university counsel to serve the papers on the standing counsel for the RPF Commissioner.\n\nThe issue dates back to the period between 2006 and 2010 when the then State government had established Anna University of Technology (AUT) in Coimbatore and four other districts. However, in 2012, all the five AUTs were merged with the Anna University in Chennai.\n\nPursuant to a complaint received in 2019 regarding non-payment of provident fund to contract workers engaged by the university, the RPF Commissioner inspected the varsity campus in Coimbatore and found non-compliance of the Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952.\n\nThereafter, a show cause notice was issued to the university for determination of dues with respect to the contract employees working in the Coimbatore regional centre of the varsity since March 1, 2010 and an interim order was passed on February 8, 2022 to deposit \u20b92.44 crore within 15 days.\n\nThe university took the interim order on appeal to the Central Government Industrial Tribunal which, on May 12, 2022, granted an interim stay of the RPF Commissioner\u2019s order but on condition that the varsity must deposit 45% (\u20b91.09 crore) of the dues determined by the commissioner.\n\nThereafter, a writ petition was filed in the High Court in 2023 for relaxation of the condition imposed by the tribunal. Then, the university contended that the EPF Act would not be applicable to it at all and therefore, it had a good chance of winning the case before the tribunal.\n\nOn the other hand, a standing counsel for the RPF Commissioner contended that the tribunal should have actually ordered deposit of 75% of the dues as a pre-condition to entertain the appeal and that an employer could not be allowed to escape from the liability of ensuring social security to the employees.\n\nAfter hearing both sides and taking the financial position of the university also into consideration, Justice M. Dhandapani disposed of the writ petition on August 16, 2023 with a direction to deposit 30% of the dues within six weeks and hence the present writ appeal.",

We had to evacuate around 15 children and women staff from a marooned day-care centre to a nearby home. Then their parents were informed who came and picked them,\u201d said Saji Kumar, assistant station officer, Eloor fire station.\n\nThe five-member team had to deploy a rubber dinghy to evacuate occupants from some 10-odd houses, including a 75-year-old bedridden woman. The dinghy was also used for distributing food arranged by the division councillor and residents\u2019 association for those who declined to move out but shifted to the first floor of their inundated houses.\n\nHelp for removal of fallen trees disrupting traffic after being uprooted in strong wind dominated calls received at fire stations on the day. Firefighters from stations with fewer calls pitched in for their busier counterparts from other stations. The team from the Club Road station in the city thus came to the help of their Eloor counterparts. In one instance, a team from the Aroor fire station from the neighbouring Alappuzha district was pressed into service in West Kochi.\n\nFirefighters from the Thrikkakara fire station were called up to rescue a man trapped in flooding in Vidya Nagar colony, while a short-circuit was reported at the strong room on the Cusat campus where electronic voting machines are stored.\n\nThe widespread power disruption owing to snapped lines caused by fallen trees kept Kerala State Electricity Board officials busy as well. \u201cWe had to switch off transformers at severely flooded areas and in some cases had to wait till the early hours of Wednesday morning to charge them again. KSEB did not suffer any property loss,\u201d said sources in the Board.",

Thakar on Wednesday issued a notice to the Special Investigation Team (SIT), seeking a status report of its ongoing inquiry against all the officials by June 20, said lawyer Rajesh Jalu, representing petitioner Vinesh Chhaya.\n\nThe petition argued that the grounds on which these officials were transferred or suspended were enough to register an FIR.\n\nThe petitioner sought an FIR against these officials under Indian Penal Code sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 337 (causing hurt to someone by acting in a way that is rash or negligent and endangers human life or the safety of others) and 338 (causing grievous hurt to someone by an act that endangers their life or personal safety).\n\nAlso read | Rajkot fire tragedy: Another game zone partner held; one accused died in blaze, say Police\n\n\"The reason for filing this present complaint has also arisen because 27 persons have died and other persons injured due to their carelessness in duties,\" the plea said.\n\nThe TRP game zone was running for the last three-four years without any permissions or licence, the petition said.\n\nApart from Bhargava, then Rajkot Deputy Commissioner of Police Sudhirkumar Desai and Additional Commissioner of Police (ACP) Vidhi Choudhary as well as then Municipal Commissioner Anand Patel were transferred and kept on waiting for posting two days after the incident.\n\nAmong the suspended civic officials are chief fire officer Ilesh Kher, deputy chief fire officer Bhikhabhai Theba, assistant engineer Jaideep Chaudhary, assistant town planner Gautam Joshi, fire station officer Rahit Vigora, deputy executive engineer of roads and buildings department M.R.
