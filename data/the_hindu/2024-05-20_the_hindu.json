Satheesan has come down hard on the Health department for its alleged \u201cindifference\u201d to taking adequate preventive and control measures, while people are dying of various infectious diseases.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Mr. Satheesan said that inefficiency had become the face of the Left Democratic Front government and that the Health department exemplified it.\n\nHepatitis A spreads\n\nHe said that Hepatitis A was spreading across districts and those who are dying of complications are all from the lower economic strata, for whom the government had not extended any financial assistance. The infection continued to spread, but little was being done to contain it, he said.\n\nWhen the State was going through the phase of intense heat, several people had died suddenly. Many suffered heart attacks and stroke. At a time when there was increased anxiety amongst the public over reports about COVID\u2019s after-effects and the rare side-effect of COVID vaccination, the Health department was doing little to allay the fears of the public, Mr. Satheesan said.\n\nHe said that apart from seeking reports every time something goes wrong, the Health department did no follow-up corrective measures. The so-called reports of mishaps in the Health department would run into so many pages that it can be brought out as a book, he claimed.\n\nCompensation\n\nHe said the government had not done anything to compensate Harshina, the woman who had undergone serious health issues and suffering for years, after a surgical instrument was inadvertently left in her body after surgery. He alleged that the Health Minister was bent on not offering any compensation to the woman because she had organised a strike against the government.

The 52 year old Australian has been charged on multiple counts for publishing sensitive military and diplomatic cables in 2010 and violating the U.S.\u2019s Espionage Act. The U.S. has argued that lives were put at risk because of the leaked documents contained unredacted names.\n\nIn May the court cleared the extradition conditional on the U.S. providing two assurances : one, the death penalty would not be applied in Mr Assange\u2019s case and two, Mr Assange would be allowed to rely on the First Amendment (i.e., free speech rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution) during his trial.\n\nIn a short court session on May 20, two judges ruled that the U.S. government had not met the requirements. Specifically, in April, the U.S. government had said Mr. Assange \u201cwill have the ability to raise and seek to rely upon\u201d the First Amendment but whether that would apply to a non-US national would be up to the courts. Last week, his lawyer, Jennifer Robinson had called that a \u201cnon-assurance\u201d.\n\nA crowd gathered outside the court cheered as it heard the outcome of the legal proceedings. Addressing the crowd, Mr Assange\u2019s wife, Stella, described the U.S. arguments as \u201ctrying to paint lipstick on a pig\u201d and the case as an \u201cattack on journalists everywhere\u201d.\n\n\u201cHow long can this go on for?\u201d she said, making a case for her family to be reunited. Mr Assange has been held at the high-security Belmarsh prison since 2019. Prior to this he had spent approximately seven years in the Ecuador Embassy in London after seeking asylum there in 2012, following charges for sexual offences in Sweden. The charges were dropped in 2017.",

There should be no fear. The law of this land will take its own course. How long can this hide-and-seek game be played? I appeal to you with folded hands to surrender within 24 to 48 hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to convey this through my father but am doing it on his behalf. He (Mr. Deve Gowda) has extended all his support for Mr. Prajwal Revanna to grow in politics. If Mr. Prajwal Revanna wants to bring any respect to his grandfather and party workers, he should come back to India,\u201d Mr Kumaraswamy stated.\n\n\u201cI publicly apologise to the victims of this scandal. I can understand their pain. Who pushed them into this situation? Many similar cases have occurred in the past, although their magnitude might be less. This is a shameful episode and it makes all of us bow our heads in shame,\u201d he said.\n\nPointing out that the Congress government was demanding that he bring Mr. Prajwal Revanna back to India, the former Chief Minister said: \u201cWhen I was not aware about his whereabouts when he was in Karnataka, how will I know where he is when he is not in the country?\u201d\n\nHitting back at the ruling party, he said: \u201cLet the Congress make hundreds of attempts to target my family.

If I had known about the scandal earlier, I would not have let Mr. Prajwal Revanna leave the country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn such cases, people tend to act based on their lawyers\u2019 advice. We did not ask him to go. The SIT could have given him seven days to appear when he sought time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI requested my father (Mr. Deve Gowda) to make a public announcement that if he had any respect, Mr. Prajwal Revanna should come back and cooperate with SIT.

            "text": "In contrast to the voting trend in the State in general and the majority of Assembly constituencies of Tirupati district in particular, the Tirupati and Satyavedu Assembly segments have shown a peculiar dip in the polling percentage this year compared to the previous elections.\n\nAlthough the dip in the Tirupati Assembly segment\u2019s poll percentage is attributed to the general trend of prevailing disinterest in voting among urban voters, the reason for the declined polling percentage in the Satyavedu segment, a reserved constituency with a predominantly rural background, remained a puzzle for the poll pundits.\n\nWhile the Tirupati district saw a marginal increase of 0.15% in voter turnout in 2024, with 78.63% polling compared to 78.48% in 2019, the Tirupati Assembly segment witnessed a dip of 2.6% in polling percentage in 2024 (63.32%) from the 65.92% polling in the 2019 elections.\n\nSimilarly, the Satyavedu Assembly segment, an SC reserved constituency, also showed a decline in polling percentage by 1.16%, to 85.28% in 2024 from 86.45% in 2019.\n\nHowever, voter turnout in the other constituencies in the district increased in 2024 compared to the 2019 elections and seems to have compensated for the decline in the above two segments, resulting in a marginal increase in the district\u2019s overall voting percentage.\n\nGudur constituency saw an increase to 78.89% polling in 2024 from 78.12% in 2019, Sullurpeta to 82.92% in 2024 from 82.86% in 2019, Venkatagiri to 80.87% in 2024 from 78.56% in 2019, Chandragiri to 79.89% in 2024 from 78.13% in 2019 and Srikalahasti to 83.25% from 82.46% in 2019.\n\nOwing to the extended polling hours and violence witnessed on the very next day of polling, there was an unexpected delay in making public the actual polling percentage in the Tirupati district, said Collector and District Election Officer Pravin Kumar at a media conference here on Monday, May 20.\n\n\u201cThe poll percentage for general elections 2024 and 2019 are 78.63 and 78.48, respectively, for Tirupati district. The fall in percentage in Tirupati and Satyavedu segments was compensated by the increase in other segments, which helped in increasing the overall polling percentage in the district by 0.14%,\u201d Mr. Pravin Kumar said.\n\nTight security\n\nThe Collector said the strongrooms and counting centres in SPMVV School of Engineering and Technology and SPW Degree College had been thoroughly secured and are watched from 90 CCTV cameras monitored by a control room. He added that three Tahsildars are deployed on a shift basis to watch the security arrangements and monitor the live streaming.\n\nSuperintendent of Police V. Harshavardhan Raju said a three-tier security system comprising central forces was in place near strongrooms with the State armed police at the inner perimeter and civil police at the outer perimeter.",

            "title": "Google Pixel 8a Review: A compact AI driver for Pixel fans but pricing exceeds practicality",
            "publish_date": "2024-05-20",
            "text": "Google is here with its latest launch - Pixel 8a. As we all are aware, the addition of the \u201ca\u201d means the phone is a cheaper variant of the main Pixel 8 series. But the new Pixel 8a is packed with features that were in the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, and yes, it also has the AI features seen in the flagship variant.\n\nStarting at \u20b952,999 (8GB/128GB), the new Pixel 8a with its overall features, may not excite many of the users unless they are fans of Pixel phones. So, let\u2019s find out what all the new Pixel 8a has to offer.\n\nDesign\n\nThe design factor remains the same as that of the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro but in a more compact size. The Pixel 8a fits the hand perfectly and is easy to use. The phone is light and has a plastic build, which is unexpected for a phone in this price segment. We have usually seen mid-range phones offering a glass body.\n\nThe phone offers a minimal and aesthetic look. We got the blue variant to review. Like other Pixel phones, the new Pixel 8a has a standard button and port placement. The volume rockers are situated below the power button on the right side. A single SIM card tray is located on the left side. At the bottom, you\u2019ll find a USB Type-C 3.2 port for charging and data transfer. The phone also has an in-display fingerprint scanner for biometric authentication.\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\nWhile the Pixel 8a is IP67 certified, offering respectable protection from dust and water, utilising an IP68 rating would have been nice as per its price range. Google could have also considered enhancing the durability by opting for a higher-generation Corning Gorilla Glass, as it currently uses Gorilla Glass 3 for display protection.\n\nDisplay\n\nThe Pixel 8a features a 6.1-inch 120Hz OLED display with a 20:9 aspect ratio and a resolution of 1,080x2,400 pixels, resulting in a sharp 430 pixels per inch. The OLED panel offers deep blacks, vivid colors with 24-bit depth, and an impressive contrast ratio of over 1,000,000:1. Google has also included HDR support, which enhances the viewing experience for compatible content.\n\nThe display gets reasonably bright, with a claimed peak brightness of up to 2,000 nits, though real-world performance may vary. The Always-on display functionality is a handy addition, providing at-a-glance information without needing to wake the screen fully.\n\nOS\n\nOut of the box, the Pixel 8a runs Android 14 with the May 2024 security patch. The Pixel 8a promises seven years of operating system updates, security patches, and feature drops. As for the software experience itself, being a Pixel device, users can expect a range of AI-driven features and enhancements.\n\nProcessor\n\nPowering the Pixel 8a is Google\u2019s custom Tensor G3 system-on-chip (SoC), the same chipset found in the more expensive Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro models. Accompanying the Tensor G3 is Google\u2019s in-house Titan M2 co-processor, which handles security and machine learning tasks. The device is available in two storage configurations \u2013 8GB RAM with 128GB storage or 8GB RAM with 256GB storage, though our review unit was the former. It\u2019s worth noting that both variants use LPDDR5X RAM, a modest upgrade over the previous generation.\n\nIn day-to-day use, the Pixel 8a felt reasonably smooth when multitasking and handling demanding workloads. Gaming performance was also satisfactory, with titles like BGMI and Pokemon Go running well, thanks to the Mali-G715 GPU. However, the lack of support for cloning apps like WhatsApp is something we personally don\u2019t like in the Pixel phones.\n\nThe Pixel 8a puts up decent numbers in synthetic benchmarks like Geekbench 6. In the single-core test, it scored 1595, while the multi-core score came in at 2717. The phone also fared well in the GPU department, with a graphics score of 5538, suggesting it can handle moderate gaming and graphically intensive apps.\n\nCamera\n\nGoogle has long been lauded for the impressive camera performance of its Pixel smartphones, and the Pixel 8a aims to continue that legacy. The device features a dual rear camera setup, headlined by a 64MP quad-pixel wide camera with an f/1.89 aperture and 0.8\u03bcm pixel size. This primary shooter is accompanied by a 13MP ultra-wide camera with a 120-degree field of view, offering versatility in capturing different perspectives.\n\nWhile testing, the device\u2019s camera setup excelled at capturing vivid, detail-rich images during the day. The 64MP primary camera, combined with Google\u2019s computational photography algorithms, produced shots with excellent dynamic range, accurate colors, and sharp details, even in challenging lighting conditions. The images had a brilliant, almost lifelike quality that truly impressed.\n\nLow-light and night photography of the Pixel 8a also shines. Google\u2019s Night mode works wonders in dimly lit environments, capturing bright, noise-free images with impressive detail and color accuracy. The camera\u2019s processing prowess is particularly evident here, as it can quickly capture and combine multiple exposures to create a well-lit, natural-looking night shot in just a few seconds. This level of night photography performance is typically reserved for flagship devices, making the Pixel 8a\u2019s capabilities all the more impressive for its price point.\n\nFor selfies, the Pixel 8a packs a 13MP front-facing camera with an ultra-wide 96.5-degree field of view, ideal for fitting more people or backgrounds into your shots. While the selfie camera lacks autofocus, Google\u2019s computational photography algorithms should help ensure sharp, well-exposed self-portraits in most scenarios.\n\nWhile megapixel counts don\u2019t tell the full story, Google\u2019s computational photography capabilities, combined with the solid hardware, translates to excellent real-world performance. In our testing, the Pixel 8a consistently captured brilliant, detail-rich images in both well-lit and low-light scenarios, be it with the rear or front cameras. Google\u2019s software processing algorithms, such as HDR+ and Night Sight, work their magic to enhance dynamic range, reduce noise, and capture impressive night-time shots.\n\nThe camera experience is further enhanced by Google\u2019s suite of AI-driven features, including Magic Eraser for removing unwanted objects, Face Unblur for sharper facial details, and Real Tone for accurate skin tone rendering across different lighting conditions.\n\nBattery\n\nThe Pixel 8a packs a 4,492mAh battery, which is on par with what you\u2019d find in more expensive flagships like the Pixel 8. In the real-world, the battery life lasts a full day of moderate to heavy usage.\n\nHowever, where the Pixel 8a disappoints is in its charging speed. Despite its premium price tag, the device only supports 18W wired charging, which is frankly subpar for a modern smartphone in this segment.\n\nTopping up the battery from empty takes well over an hour, which can be frustrating if you need a quick charge. The Pixel 8a does support wireless charging, which is a welcome addition, but the glacial charging speeds remain a notable drawback. Google\u2019s decision to not include a charger in the box only adds to the inconvenience.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe Pixel 8a is for those who are deeply invested in Google\u2019s ecosystem and the Pixel experience. It brings flagship-level camera performance, capable hardware with the custom Tensor G3 chip, and an array of AI-powered features that have become synonymous with Pixel devices in a compact design.\n\nHowever, when viewed objectively against the competition, the Pixel 8a\u2019s pricing may not make it as compelling. Several rivals in this segment offer more powerful processors, faster charging speeds, and potentially better value for money. Google\u2019s decision to stick with 18W wired charging, in particular, feels like a significant oversight in an otherwise well-rounded package.\n\nUltimately, if you\u2019re a Pixel loyalist who prioritises Google\u2019s software experience and photography skills, the Pixel 8a is an excellent choice. But for those seeking raw performance or cutting-edge hardware, there are alternatives worth considering that may better meet your expectations in this price range.",

            "publish_date": "2024-05-20",
            "text": "Taiwan\u2019s new president, Lai Ching-te, said in his inauguration speech Monday that he wants peace with China and urged it to stop its military threats and intimidation of the self-governed island that Beijing claims as its own territory.\n\n\u201cI hope that China will face the reality of (Taiwan)\u2019s existence, respect the choices of the people of Taiwan, and in good faith, choose dialogue over confrontation,\u201d Lai said after being sworn into office.\n\nLai pledged to \u201cneither yield nor provoke\u201d Beijing and said he sought peace in relations with China. But he emphasized the island democracy is determined to defend itself \u201cin the face of the many threats and attempts at infiltration from China.\u201d\n\nLai\u2019s party, the Democratic Progressive Party, doesn\u2019t seek independence from China but maintains that Taiwan is already a sovereign nation.\n\nThe Chinese office in charge of Taiwan affairs criticized Lai\u2019s inauguration speech as promoting \u201cthe fallacy of separatism,\u201d inciting confrontation and relying on foreign forces to seek independence.\n\n\u201cWe will never tolerate or condone any form of \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 separatist activities,\u201d said Chen Binhua, spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office of China\u2019s State Council.\n\n\u201cNo matter how the situation on the island changes, no matter who is in power, it cannot change the fact that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one China ... and cannot stop the historical trend of the motherland\u2019s eventual reunification,\u201d Chen said.\n\nThe Chinese Ministry of Commerce on Monday also announced sanctions against Boeing and two other defense companies for arms sales to Taiwan.\n\nLai, 64, takes over from Tsai Ing-wen, who led Taiwan through eight years of economic and social development despite the COVID-19 pandemic and China\u2019s escalating military threats. Beijing views Taiwan as a renegade province and has been upping its threats to annex it by force if necessary.\n\nLai is seen as inheriting Tsai's progressive policies, including universal health care, backing for higher education and support for minority groups, including making Taiwan the first place in Asia to recognize same-sex marriages.\n\nIn his inauguration speech, Lai pledged to bolster Taiwan\u2019s social safety net and help the island advance in fields such as artificial intelligence and green energy.\n\nLai, who was vice president during Tsai\u2019s second term, came across as more of a firebrand earlier in his career. In 2017, he described himself as a \u201cpragmatic worker for Taiwan\u2019s independence,\u201d drawing Beijing\u2019s rebuke. He has since softened his stance and now supports maintaining the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and the possibility of talks with Beijing.\n\nThousands of people gathered in front of the Presidential Office Building in Taipei for the inauguration ceremony. Donning white celebratory hats, they watched the swearing-in on large screens, followed by a military march and colorful performances featuring folk dancers, opera performers and rappers. Military helicopters flew in formation, carrying Taiwan's flag.\n\nLai accepted congratulations from fellow politicians and delegations from the 12 nations that maintain official diplomatic relations with Taiwan, as well as politicians from the U.S., Japan and various European states.\n\nLai, also known by his English name William, has vowed to continue his predecessor\u2019s push to maintain stability with China while beefing up Taiwan\u2019s security through imports of military equipment from close partner the U.S., the expansion of the defense industry with the manufacture of submarines and aircraft, and the reinforcing of regional partnerships with unofficial allies such as the U.S., Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken congratulated Lai on his inauguration. \u201cWe look forward to working with President Lai and across Taiwan\u2019s political spectrum to advance our shared interests and values, deepen our longstanding unofficial relationship, and maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,\u201d Blinken said in a statement from his office.\n\nThe U.S. doesn\u2019t formally recognize Taiwan as a country but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself.\n\nJapan\u2019s government spokesperson, Yoshimasa Hayashi, said it continues to expect a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan issue through dialogue.\n\n\u201cThe peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait is important not only for the security of Japan but the stability of all of the international community,\u201d Hayashi said Monday.\n\nLai\u2019s relatively conciliatory tone will come across as reassuring to foreign governments that may have been concerned about his past reputation as a firebrand, said Danny Russell, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute.\n\n\u201cThere is virtually nothing that Lai could have said, short of \u2018unconditional surrender,\u2019 that would satisfy Beijing,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough Lai signaled he would maintain the overall direction of Tsai's policy regarding Beijing, he struck a more sovereignty-affirming tone in his speech, said Amanda Hsiao, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group.\n\n\u201cThis likely fits within Beijing's low expectations of Lai, so it won't necessarily change their response,\u201d Hsiao said. \u201cChina was always going to respond negatively to Lai.\u201d\n\nDuring her tenure, Tsai oversaw a controversial pension and labor reform and extended the military conscription length to one year. She also kickstarted a military modernization drive.\n\nTsai\u2019s leadership during the pandemic split public opinion, with most admiring Taiwan\u2019s initial ability to keep the virus largely outside its borders but criticizing the lack of investment in rapid testing as the pandemic progressed.",

However, these forest divisions will be included in the exercise conducted once in five years which is next scheduled for 2028 and the previous exercise was in 2023 which indicated that Karnataka had 6395 elephants.\n\nBut as only 10 forest divisions bordering the neighbouring southern States have been included in the exercise, the elephant population figures that will emerge will also be significantly less than the 2023 figures which were for the entire State. But these 10 divisions account for almost 80 per cent of the Karnataka elephant population, said Mr. Pushkar.\n\nIn the 2023 exercise covering the entire State Bandipur had 1116 elephants and it was the highest for Karnataka followed by 831 elephants in Nagarahole. BRT Tiger Reserve with 619 elephants and M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary with 706 elephants were other major reserves with sizeable elephant populations.\n\nMr. Pushkar said synchronised population estimation exercise of the wildlife in the interstate region will help provide valuable insights into population dynamics and help in the management of the conflict in a holistic manner. This is crucial for designing the conflict management strategies, he added.",

            "text": "The Department of Archaeology, Museums and Heritage (DAMH) will offer a 3D walkthrough of important monuments in Karnataka in a bid to kindle interest in them and promote tourism.\n\nThe DAMH has finalised 10 monuments to start with, though the long-term plan is to provide such a virtual tour of 530 monuments, all of which will be uploaded on the website of the department.\n\nA. Devaraj, Commissioner, DAMH, told The Hindu that the project has received budgetary support and \u20b91 crore has been set aside for the purpose. The walkthrough of the selected sites will be created using 3D Immersive and Generative AI technology to provide users an immersive experience.\n\nThe objective of the 3D walkthrough is to create interest among people experiencing the virtual tour to actually visit the site, which will boost tourism.\n\nThe DAMH has entrusted the work of 3D laser mapping of monuments to Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology. The project is now complete.\n\n\u2018\u2019We have to utilise the 3D mapped data and put it to proper use. Providing people with a virtual tour is one way of doing it,\u201d said Mr. Devaraj.\n\nThough the Department cannot take up the work pertaining to 530 monuments, it will make a beginning with 10 monuments spread across Karnataka, and subsequently try to collaborate with third parties who express interest in the concept, Mr. Devaraj added.\n\nThe quality of the 3D laser scanning of the monuments is of the highest quality and resolution. Details of the ceilings and carvings at the top of the pillars or other parts of the monuments that are not normally visible to the naked eye, come alive in the 3D scanned maps. \u201cThe visuals are superior to any video or photograph,\u201d said Mr. Devaraj.\n\nApart from triggering interest in the monuments, the experience of taking a virtual tour is different, and is akin to being physically present at the place. This is different from viewing a static picture and, hence, the technology will be harnessed to give the DAMH\u2019s website a touch of the state-of-the-art.\n\nThe monuments selected from the Mysuru division are Varahaswamy temple in Mysuru, Chamarajeshwara temple in Chamarajanagar. In neighbouring Mandya district, the sites shortlisted are kalyani (tank) and Bhuvaneshwari Mantapa, and the ancillary shrines at Melkote\n\nIn Bengaluru division, Lakshminarasimha temple at Devalapura in Holalkere taluk of Chitradurga district, and Lakshminarasimhaswamy temple at Bhadravati in Shivamogga district are in the list.\n\nFrom the UNESCO world heritage site of Hampi in Kalaburagi division, the DAMH has selected the Virupaksha temple in Vijayanagar district while Shor Gubaz, which is reckoned to have inspired the more famous Gol Gumbaz, has been finalised from Kalaburagi division. In addition, Bijapur arch and Afzal Khan\u2019s mosque have been included in the project.\n\nIn Belagavi division, the authorities will take up Veeranarayana temple at Gadag and Kashilinga temple at Saptasagara in Athani taluk of Belagavi district for the 3D walkthrough project.\n\nMr. Devaraj expressed confidence that going forward, some private companies could fund the project and the department could even tie up with startups, who have the technology for 3D immersive and AI technologies.",

The staff walk the transect line and record the data about elephant dung piles on the either side of the line.\n\nThe Forest Department has said block count and line transect exercise help in the abundance estimation of elephants in these habitats. Along with the forest cover, land use type data and the field data obtained, current elephant use/distribution area, mean elephant density and number of elephants is also calculated.\n\nOn May 25, waterhole direct count exercise will be taken up complete with photographic evidence. The waterholes/salt licks/open areas, with maximum use by elephants have been identified and fixed-point observation is undertaken for elephants from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. at these selected locations, according to the authorities.\n\nThe size of the herd, age and gender of the individuals is recorded along with photographs of the individuals or groups. This data is used to assess the age and sex distribution (demography) of the elephant populations.\n\nThe data generated will be compiled and scientists from IISc, Bengaluru will analyse it using statistical methods. After the analysis, population estimation shall be obtained for all the four States for the areas falling on the boundary of each of the State, said the authorities.",

Solanki, a veteran mountaineer and founder of Tiger Adventure Foundation, who led the trekking expedition.\n\nThe ten-day expedition, which began from Shivalik base camp at Dhak in Uttarakhand on May 1, also comprised three trekkers in their 50s. \u201cApart from one 70-year-old and two persons in their 60s, we also had three persons in their 50s,\u201d pointed out Mr. Solanki.\n\nOne trekker in his 50s was also a cardiac patient with a stent. \u201cBut, all of them successfully scaled the two mountain peaks and completed the trek,\u201d he added.\n\nAll the participants not only underwent training sessions, but also a medical check up to ascertain their fitness for the expedition. In the mountains, the trekkers were adequately hydrated by ensuring they were frequently drinking water, he said adding that no need arose for medicine for acute mountain sickness, which affects a few people in high altitudes.\n\nAfter reaching Shivalik base camp in Uttarakhand, the trekkers camped Tali and Khullara before embarking upon an acclimatisation trek to 12,500 ft. high Mount Kuari on May 4. Upon their return, the trekkers experienced downpour and snowfall in the mountain ranges, which brought down the temperatures to minus 9 degrees.\n\nBut, on May 6, the trekkers were ready for the arduous trek of Pangarchulla situated at a height of around 15,000 ft. Armed with their trekking gear including hiking poles, ice axes, and crampons among other things, the trekkers began their ascent at 12.15 a.m. in the night. With head torches to show them the way through the 6.5 km long nocturnal trek, the group reached their destination at 8.17 a.m. braving chilly wind and minus 11 degrees centigrade.\n\nThe trekking group also comprised Santosh B., Riya Solanki, Anil Kumar, Santosh R., Tanushree, Afsa Sullia, Shruthvik, Mahesh Kaje, Venkatesh, Mehul C., Preksha Jain, and Chahel Jain.

            "publish_date": "2024-05-20",
            "text": "Synuclein alpha (SNCA) is a mysterious protein. It\u2019s present in healthy cells but we don\u2019t know what it does there. It is notorious for its involvement in age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Twenty-seven years ago, researchers first associated SNCA with Parkinson\u2019s disease. People with this disease lose neurons that communicate with each other using dopamine as a neurotransmitter in a part of their brains.\n\nThese dopaminergic neurons have been found to contain aggregated masses of proteins called Lewy bodies. Most of these proteins are SNCA.\n\nSince then, researchers have reported SNCA in similar aggregates in the brains of people with other neurodegenerative diseases as well. But its presence is most prominent in brains with Parkinson\u2019s.\n\nSNCA is abundant in neurons, especially in dopaminergic neurons. It is found near the nuclei of these cells and at the junctions between two neurons. It\u2019s capable of misfolding as well as forming filamentous structures. So unlike most other proteins, which take up predictable three-dimensional structures, SNCA can fold in multiple ways. Misfolded proteins don\u2019t function correctly.\n\nBut beyond these observations, researchers don\u2019t understand the dynamics of the formation of these aggregates and how exactly they affect neurons.\n\nTwo populations\n\nA recent study from Swasti Raychaudhuri\u2019s lab at the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, published in the Journal of Cell Science, reported two ways in which SNCA is present as aggregates in cells: one that interferes with the structural integrity of cells\u2019 nuclei and another that allows the cell to degrade misfolded proteins. The researchers found that the former are related to diseased states while the latter is important for healthy cells.\n\nAs such, the study highlights the importance of striking a balance between these two SNCA populations to manage Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nThe researchers cultivated neurons outside a living body, providing them with nutrients in a laboratory setup. In these neurons, they artificially created structures resembling Lewy bodies by adding some amount of misfolded SNCA, called seeds.\n\nOver time, they found two SNCA populations in the cells: one was around the nuclei, shaped like filaments tens of micrometres long, much like Lewy bodies. The other population was also around the nuclei but as much smaller clumps called aggresomes. Such aggresomes are formed when cells localise misfolded proteins into a small bunch (like collecting the trash in a corner) for further processing.\n\nBreaching the nucleus\n\nThey noticed that the Lewy-body-like structures formed very slowly. Most of the time, the aggresomes took up the SNCA proteins and didn\u2019t allow the Lewy-body-like structures to grow. But in their experiment, when the researchers repeatedly seeded neurons with misfolded SNCA, the Lewy-body-like structures formed faster and became big enough to affect other parts of the cell. At one point, they became too populous for the aggresomes to mitigate their prevalence.\n\nThe enlarged Lewy-body-like structures were situated at the periphery of the nuclei of the cells, and the researchers have argued that this damages the nuclear envelope. Sometimes, the structures also entered the ruptured nucleus.\n\nA nucleus is the control centre of the cell. It contains the cell\u2019s genetic material, and is the seat of upkeep of this genetic material and its utilisation to make proteins. So it is logical that the accumulation of misfolded SNCA would render the nucleus dysfunctional and eventually kill it. In addition, Lewy-body-like structures can pass from one cell to another, so the effect could cascade to neighbouring cells as well.\n\nDr. Raychaudhuri\u2019s team was able to cross-check its findings in mice with Lewy-body-like structures in their brains. They reported that the increasing prevalence of these structures induced conditions mimicking Parkinson\u2019s disease. They also found that all the cells so affected also had damaged nuclear envelopes.\n\nA therapeutic target?\n\nMany Parkinson\u2019s disease researchers are focused on reducing the prevalence of SNCA in neurons as a therapeutic measure. Researchers are going about this in various ways, but haven\u2019t yet found one that has been approved for sale.\n\nOne way is to reduce the cells\u2019 SNCA content. A smaller population of SNCA means fewer misfolded SNCA, too. Researchers have achieved this by stopping the SNCA gene from expressing itself or by destroying the SNCA protein inside cells, once the cells make them. However, either of these interventions needs to happen only in select locations: if all the SNCA everywhere is taken away, the animal body will die.\n\nAnother workable solution has been to use a gene-silencing tool, like CRISPR-Cas9, at a precise location. Researchers have tried this method in cell cultures and model animals. But a significant challenge is to cross the blood-brain barrier, a liquid that filters the blood that goes into the brain, and which would also prevent a component CRISPR from passing through.\n\nTo surmount this barrier, some researchers have tried to inject molecules that inhibit the SNCA gene through the skull, directly into the desired brain region. Others have used small molecules like modified viruses to beat the barrier. Some researchers have also identified enzymes that degrade proteins in select brain cells, but with varying efficacy.\n\nAnother possibility is to stop SNCA from forming large aggregates. Dr. Raychaudhuri has suggested balancing the SNCA population between aggresomes and Lewy bodies. The more SNCA that goes into the aggresomes, the less there will be available to make Lewy bodies. How this can be achieved is still being worked out.\n\nEven if any one of these methods succeeds, it will transform the way Parkinson\u2019s disease is treated today. Today, Parkinson\u2019s is treated symptomatically by increasing the levels of dopamine or, more drastically, by grafting new neurons in place of dead ones. An SNCA-based solution is more desirable because it offers a more sustainable resolution.\n\nSomdatta Karak, PhD heads science communication and public outreach at CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology.",

            "publish_date": "2024-05-20",
            "text": "The story so far: To strengthen the existing regulatory framework for long gestation period financing for projects such as infrastructure, non-infrastructure and commercial real estate sectors, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued draft regulations for consultation earlier this month. The regulations endeavour to provide a \u201charmonised prudential framework\u201d for financing projects. It also proposes to revise the criteria for changing the date of commencement of commercial operations (DCCO) of such projects. As per the banking regulator, this is in light of a review of the extant instructions and analysis of the risks inherent in such financing. Comments on the draft direction are solicited until June 15.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the project financing framework?\n\nInfrastructure projects usually have a long gestation period, with a higher probability of not being financially viable. It may not always be possible to meet investment requirements of the projects fully from the budgetary resources of the government. This opens up two financing avenues: public private partnerships and project financing from domestic financial institutions. The latter is particularly crucial for certain projects with longer payback periods. Depending on scale and technology, these projects may also require a loan with a longer tenure.\n\nSuch projects may face multiple obstacles leading to delays or cost-overruns. For perspective, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation\u2019s March review of 1,837 projects observed that 779 of them were delayed and 449 faced cost overruns. Cost overruns stood at \u20b95.01 lakh crores when compared with their original cost. The review attributed the delay to land acquisition, obtaining forest/environment clearances, changes in scope (and size), and delays in tendering, ordering and obtaining equipment, among other things. Cost overruns were primarily due to under-estimation of original cost, high cost of environmental safeguards and rehabilitation measures for those displaced and spiralling land acquisition costs.\n\nThese factors are dampeners for banks, which would have priced the risks associated with the project in a certain way on their books. As explained by the then Deputy Governor of RBI, Harun R. Khan (2012), \u201cThe added uncertainty due to these factors (legal and procedural) affects the risk appetite of investors as well as banks to extend funds for the development of infrastructure.\u201d\n\nWhat are the more important revisions?\n\nRBI\u2019s focus is on mitigating a \u2018credit event,\u2019 that is, a default or a need to extend the original DCCO or infuse additional debt, and/or diminution in the net present value (NPV) of the project.\n\nOne of the more important revisions concerns \u2018provisioning,\u2019 that is, setting aside some money ahead of time to compensate for a potential loss. The proposed framework recommends that, at the construction stage (that is, when the financial assessment is finalised and before commencement), a general provision of 5% is to be maintained on all existing and fresh exposures. This is a revision from the erstwhile 0.4%. Concerns have emerged about the impact on the cost of debt. According to CareEdge Ratings, this would \u201cdampen the bidding appetite from infrastructure developers in the medium term.\u201d This 5% provisioning would be implemented in a phased manner, that is, 2% for FY25, 3.5% for the next financial year and eventually 5% in FY27.\n\nThe framework stipulates that the provisioning can be reduced to 2.5% and 1% at the operational phase (that is, commencement of commercial operations). For the latter, the project must have a positive net operating cash flow to cover all repayment obligations and total long-term debt must have declined by at least 20% from the outstanding when the DCCO is achieved.\n\n\u201cProjects with stable cash flows, like road annuities, transmission and commercial real estate, typically see an improvement in credit profile within one year of establishing a payment track record from the counterparty. Therefore, the mandate could delay the realisation of interest rate benefits for such projects, despite an enhanced credit profile,\u201d CareEdge states in its report. It is important to note that, being capital intensive, infrastructure projects are sensitive to interest rates. However, it adds, the move would address \u201crisks associated with bulky back-ended repayments and subsequent refinancing.\u201d\n\nDoes the framework introduce prudential conditions for financing projects?\n\nThe framework seeks that all mandatory pre-requisites must be in place before the financial year\u2019s closure (thus, before the finalising of a financial statement). The indicative list must provide environmental, regulatory and legal clearances relevant to the project. It is only for PPP projects that the framework proposes to accept half of the stipulated land availability for financial closure.\n\nThe DCCO must be clearly spelt out. Financial disbursals would be made and the progress in equity infusion agreed to based on the stages of completion. For PPP projects, the disbursal should begin only after the de facto handing over of a contract letter to the developer. The onus is on the bank to deploy an independent engineer or architect who would be responsible for certifying the project\u2019s progress.\n\nRBI proposes to mandate that a positive Net Present Value (NPV) be a prerequisite to obtain project finance. It also seeks that lenders get the project NPV independently re-evaluated every year. This is to help them avert the possibility of any build-up of stress and have an action plan in place.\n\nDoes the framework provide scope to revise repayment norms?\n\nYes. However, the framework proposes that the original or revised repayment tenure, inclusive of the moratorium period, must not exceed 85% of the economic life of the project.\n\nRBI\u2019s proposed framework also recommends certain criteria for evaluating a change in repayment schedule due to an increase in the project outlay if there\u2019s an increase in scope and size of the project. This revision will have to take place before commencement of commercial operations, after lenders offer a satisfactory re-assessment about the viability of the project, and if the risk in project cost, excluding any cost overrun, is 25% or more of the original outlay. Cost overruns happen when expenditures exceed the budgeted project outlay, whereas increase in costs refers to the difference between the original budget and the final cost at completion.\n\nSignificantly, the framework also introduces guidelines to trigger a standby credit facility. This is to be sanctioned at the time of financial closure to fund overruns arising due to delays. The framework stipulates an incremental funding of 10% of the original project cost.\n\nWhat have initial observations been?\n\nThe ongoing impact assessment is ascertaining potential impacts on banks\u2019 profitability, risk appetite for future project financing and a rise in credit costs.\n\nRatings agency ICRA observed in a report that higher provisioning requirement for projects under implementation would impact the profitability of non-banking financial companies (and infrastructure financing companies), though the impact would be spread across a three-year period. ICRA also said it estimates funding costs could go up by 20-40 basis points (bps) in some cases. This is because lenders would look to build an additional risk premium when pricing their loans.\n\nIn their recent earnings call, three state-owned lenders\u2014 State Bank of India (SBI), Union Bank of India and Bank of Baroda (BoB)\u2014 expressed confidence in the proposal not having any \u201csignificant\u201d impact. However, SBI Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara indicated that pricing of loans may have to be revisited. Mr. Khara also mentioned that RBI\u2019s concern could be about the \u201cright pricing of risk by some lenders,\u201d especially those of long tenures, say 15 years.\n\nBoB CEO Devdutt Chand indicated that credit costs will not go up \u201csignificantly\u201d\u2013 potentially \u201ca couple of\u201d points below 10 bps only.",

            "publish_date": "2024-05-20",
            "text": "Ebrahim Raisi, like Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, wore a black turban, which means he traced his lineage back to the Prophet Mohammed. Before being elected President in November 2021, he was the chief of Iran\u2019s judiciary. A close ally of Mr. Khamenei, Raisi, after his controversial election victory, helped the conservatives tighten their grip on Iran\u2019s state and society, after an eight-year period of Hassan Rouhani, the architect of Iran\u2019s failed nuclear deal with world powers. As President, Mr. Raisi tightened crackdown at home, strengthened Iran\u2019s ties with Russia and China and adopted a much more muscular foreign policy, which saw Tehran launching an unprecedented missile and drone attack towards Israel in April. He was seen as a potential successor to Mr. Khamenei, the most powerful man in the Islamic Republic. But such predictions did not last long.\n\nOn May 19, President Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and a few other officials were killed in a helicopter crash in the Varzaghan region of East Azerbaijan province.\n\nRaisi\u2019s 2017 electoral defeat did not deter him\n\nRaisi\u2019s rise to the top echelons of the Islamic Republic was gradual. He contested the 2017 Presidential election, with backing from the clergy, but lost to Mr. Rouhani, who then secured a second term. But the electoral defeat did not deter Raisi. In 2019, he was appointed the Chief Justice. In the same year, he was named deputy chief of the 88-member Assembly of Experts, the clerical body that will pick the next Supreme Leader when Ayatollah Ali Khamenei departs.\n\nIn the 2021 Presidential election, there were complaints that the establishment was clearly favouring Raisi. Mr. Rouhani, a popular figure among the reformists and moderates, was constitutionally barred from seeking a third consecutive term. Other prominent moderate candidates, former Parliament speaker Ali Larijani and outgoing Vice-President Eshaq Jahangiri, were excluded from running by the Guardian Council. The 12-member Council, which vets potential candidates, allowed only seven contestants \u2014 two low-key moderates and five hardliners \u2014 to run. Raisi was the only prominent figure on the list. Closer to the election, two more candidates dropped out, boosting Raisi\u2019s chances. There were no surprises when the results were announced.\n\nBorn in 1960 in a village near the holy city of Mashhad, Raisi, as a teenager, studied in a Qom seminary. When Iran erupted against the rule of the Shah in the late 1970s, Raisi, like many other seminary students, liberals and leftwing activists, joined the revolution. After the Pahlavi dynasty was overthrown and Iran became an Islamic Republic, Raisi began his judicial career as a prosecutor in the city of Karaj. He moved to the capital in 1985 after he was appointed a deputy prosecutor of Tehran. It was this time Raisi got the attention of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.\n\nRaisi was a member of \u2018death commission,\u2019 set up to carry out executions\n\nAfter the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88, Khomeini issued secret decrees condemning thousands of political prisoners (mostly members of the People\u2019s Mujahedin of Iran, a dissident group backed by Saddam Hussein that carried out attacks after Iran accepted a ceasefire, and supporters of leftist factions such as the Fedaian and the Tudeh Party) to death. Then a four-man commission, which is widely known as the \u201cdeath commission\u201d, was set up to carry out the executions. Raisi was reported to be a member of the commission. A 2019 U.S. Treasury Department release, which imposed sanctions on top Iranian officials, including Raisi, \u201cfor advancing domestic and foreign oppression\u201d, states that \u201cas deputy prosecutor general of Tehran, Raisi participated in a so-called \u2018death commission\u2019 that ordered the extrajudicial executions of thousands of political prisoners in 1988.\u201d According to rights groups, including Amnesty International which released a report on the killings in 1990, thousands were killed after sham trials. Iran has never acknowledged the killings. Raisi never talked about it publicly, even during his Presidential campaigns.\n\nRaisi held important positions in Iran\u2019s judicial system\n\nAlways a loyal ally of the establishment, Raisi held several important positions in Iran\u2019s judicial system. From 2004 to 2014, he was the First Deputy Chief Justice. In 2014, he was named the Attorney-General of Iran, a position which he held until 2016. Then Mr. Khamenei appointed him to run the Astan-e Quds-e Razavi (Imam Reza charity foundation), which manages a wide network of businesses and endowments. These foundations, run largely on donations or assets seized during the 1979 revolution worth billions, operate directly under the Supreme Leader. When he was appointed to the foundation, Mr. Khamenei called Raisi a \u201ctrustworthy person with high-profile experience\u201d, a rare praise from the Supreme Leader that fuelled speculations that the Ayatollah could be grooming him as a potential successor.\n\nRaisi\u2019s answer to Iran\u2019s myriad problems was \u2018maximum resistance\u2019\n\nRaisi assumed Presidency at a critical juncture for Iran. The country\u2019s economy, battered by sanctions, was facing serious challenges. The nuclear deal, which promised removal of sanctions and economic prosperity, had fallen apart. Large-scale protests broke out across the country after Mahsa Amini, 22, died after she was arrested for not following the country\u2019s strict hijab rules. Raisi backed a crackdown on the protests instead of caving in to pressure. Diplomacy took a backseat during his tenure as Iran stepped up its nuclear programme, started shipping weapons to Russia, and doubled down on its support for non-state militias across West Asia such as Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthis, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Shia Mobilisation Units. Maximum resistance was Raisi\u2019s answer to the myriad problems Iran was facing. And in Iran\u2019s clergy-dominated complex power theatre where traditionalists and moderates compete for power and influence, Raisi emerged as a strong President who has the backing of the clerical establishment.\n\nRaisi\u2019s death will cause vacuum in Iran\u2019s politics\n\nRaisi\u2019s death will leave a vacuum in Iran\u2019s religious-politico system. In recent years, Iran, unlike any other country, has lost several high profile figures. In January 2020, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, a charismatic military commander, was assassinated by the U.S. in Baghdad in an air strike. In November that year, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was assassinated in the outskirts of Tehran, reportedly by Israel. After the Hamas-Israel war began on October 7, 2023, Iran lost several senior military leaders, including Mohammed Reza Zahedi, who was in charge of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 operations in Syria and Lebanon. These losses pale in comparison with the death of the President and the Foreign Minister. This is the first time the Islamic Republic is losing a President, sitting or former, to such an accident.\n\nWhile details are yet to emerge about the crash, the existing geopolitical tensions could fuel speculations about the accident. Iran has to quickly ascertain the reasons behind the crash, and put in place an orderly transition, which involves an election within weeks, so that the country\u2019s normal operations would not be affected by the President\u2019s death.",

Kunhalikutty and State president Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal stay away from the function, they successfully persuaded Congress leaders Ramesh Chennithala and V.D. Satheesan not to attend. But Congress leader K. Muraleedharan acknowledged the Samastha invite.\n\nIUML role\n\nAlthough Mr. Kunhalikutty and Mr. Thangal said that they could not attend the Samastha function because of an IUML State-level review meeting, party sources said their boycott was a predetermined one, so too was their role in the non-participation of Mr. Chennithala and Mr. Satheesan.\n\nAlthough leaders of both the IUML and the Samastha attempted to play down the absence of Mr. Kunhalikutty and Mr. Thangal as well as some leaders of the Kerala Muslim Cultural Committee (KMCC), the overseas wing of the IUML, both tacitly agree that they were drifting away from each other.\n\nMatter of supremacy\n\nA large section within the Samastha are of the opinion that the IUML State president should never be allowed to supersede the Samastha president. They insist that when Samastha president Syed Jifri Muthukoya Thangal is there, Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal should never get the prime focus.\n\nAn advertisement of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) that the Suprabhatham carried during the election campaign too helped strain the relations between the IUML and the Samastha.\n\nThe IUML has been of the view that the Samastha mouthpiece should not carry the LDF advertisement. But the Samastha continues to maintain that the newspaper is politically independent.\n\nSeveral people, directly and indirectly, criticised the IUML for staying away from the function. Among them was Minister for Tourism P.A. Mohammed Riyas, who was a guest at the function.\n\nIUML baiter and former Local Self-Government Minister K.T. Jaleel, in a social media post, described the boycott as a \u201cHimalayan blunder\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Samastha does not intervene in the content of the IUML mouthpiece Chandrika. But the IUML cannot offer that freedom back to the Samastha. It is the failure of the IUML in ensuring mutual respect that leads to strained relationship between them. If the IUML does not realise this, the party will suffer further,\u201d said Mr. Jaleel.",

            "text": "As the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) took over the security of most parts of the Parliament on May 20, questions swirl around the future of the unarmed Parliament Security Service (PSS) unit, the existence of which coincides with the adoption of Constitution of India in 1950.\n\nThe unit, formerly known as the Watch and Ward Staff, initially came into existence in 1929 after Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt dropped bombs on the Central Legislative Assembly, currently the old parliament building or the Samvidhan Sadan. A new parliament building facing the old structure was inaugurated last year.\n\nAlso read | Delhi Police out; CISF takes over Parliament security\n\nOfficials questioned the handing over of key functions to CISF, one of the only paramilitary forces with limited experience in interacting with the public \u2014 at airports and metro stations.\n\nApprehensions abound\n\nWhile the orders for deploying CISF in the lobby and the precincts of the new parliament building are yet to be announced, officials said a PSS component will have to be retained as CISF officials may not be adept in recognising the members of parliament or former members or prevent the entry of an \u201cimposter\u201d.\n\n\u201cPSS is well-trained to interact with MPs, former MPs etc. It is their House. There is a difference between handling airport security and the parliament, an autonomous body. I have not seen any such order till now about CISF induction taking place on the orders of the Speaker, the ultimate authority. The orders are being issued by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), which sets a wrong precedent,\u201d said P.D.T. Achary, constitutional expert and former Secretary General of the Lok Sabha.\n\nIt was under Mr. Achary\u2019s tenure that the watch and ward staff was renamed PSS in 2008. He added that replacing PSS would pose a risk and that even every State Assembly has their own watch and ward staff to facilitate the elected representatives.\n\nTiruchi Siva, Rajya Sabha MP from Tamil Nadu, told The Hindu that he was stopped thrice by the CISF personnel on Monday.\n\n\u201cI was in Parliament to attend a programme, the CISF personnel stopped me thrice and checked my identity card. This was not the case earlier as PSS staff recognised us and facilitated the entry,\u201d Mr. Siva said, adding that PSS was an integral part of parliament security.\n\nLast week, the Parliament Duty Group of the Central Reserve Police Force (CPRF) deployed for peripheral security was withdrawn. Earlier, Delhi Police deployed for frisking and scanning of bags were also removed from Parliament security responsibilities. The last time such large-scale changes were made was after the December 13, 2001, terror attack when terrorists stormed the building. Two PSS officials, Matbar Singh Negi and Jagdish Prasad Yadav, were killed while performing their duty.\n\nA week after a security breach was reported in the new building on December 13, 2023, the MHA accorded in-principle approval to the CISF to survey the Parliament premises and its buildings for regular deployment of personnel on a comprehensive pattern under the Government Building Security.\n\nThe overall security is administered by the Lok Sabha Secretariat.\n\nAn uncertain future\n\nThis development has several PSS officials worried about their future. \u201cWe were hired by the Parliament secretariat. Since morning, our attendance application has replaced the subject Parliament of India with Government of India. We are hearing that they will force us to retire at 55. No fresh hirings have been done in the past ten years,\u201d said a PSS official.\n\nAccording to the Sectional Manual of Office Procedure of PSS published by the Rajya Sabha Secretariat in 2010, the Parliament Security Service maintains proper liaison and effective coordination with other security agencies \u201cfor arranging a fail-proof and user friendly security\u201d.\n\n\u201cWith the passage of time, PSS acquired specialization in the field of Identification of Members of Parliament and VIPs and Officers/staff so as to avoid any undue harassment to any MP and staff working in the Parliament Complex and ensure that no imposter/unauthorised person gets entry,\u201d it said.",

Sridhar Babu and Komatireddy Venkat Reddy, who briefed reporters about the Cabinet deliberations, said procurement of paddy cultivated during the rabi season was progressing at a brisk pace with more than 36 lakh metric tonne procured so far at minimum support price (MSP).\n\n\u201cGrain is procured from farmers at MSP and the amounts are being credited into the accounts of farmers within three days. This is an unprecedented development and farmers are happy with the government\u2019s action,\u201d Mr. Srinivas Reddy said.\n\nUntimely rains had, however, affected the standing crop as well as the harvested ones which arrived in the markets, but the government was committed to procuring paddy till the last grain by paying MSP. Officials concerned were asked to enumerate losses incurred by farmers in some parts of the State and the reports were submitted to the government. \u201cFarmers should not believe in the misleading statements being issued by \u201cfriends\u201d as they are known for speaking lies,\u201d he said in an indirect dig at the Opposition parties, the BRS in particular.\n\nThe government had also directed the officials concerned to keep stocks of seeds, fertilizers and other requirements of farmers ready as the kharif season was set to commence soon. Steps had been initiated to keep a check on the circulation of spurious seeds and fertilizers, and the officials concerned were directed to initiate stringent steps against those indulging in the sale of spurious seeds and fertilizers. Farmers were advised to purchase seeds and fertilizers sold by recognised companies rather than opting for loose sales.\n\nModel schools\n\nMr. Sridhar Babu said the government has decided to improve infrastructure in State-run educational institutions and had accordingly sanctioned \u20b9600 crore in this direction. The Cabinet had approved release of \u20b9120 crore for taking up the remaining works in the schools so that there was qualitative and quantitative improvement in the schools by June 12, the day they are supposed to reopen.\n\n\u201cThe education sector was among the most neglected during the previous government\u2019s rule. As assured in our manifesto, we have initiated steps to create qualitative human resources,\u201d he said.",

The inaugural auction of this women-led venture took place at the Spices Park in Puttady on Saturday.\n\nAssistant Director, Puttady Spices Park, K.A. Anil Kumar said 16 licensed cardamom auction companies are under the Board. \u201cThis is the first time a female cardamom farmer is controlling a cardamom auction company registered under the Board. The company\u2019s specialty is that all 49 director board members are active cardamom farmers,\u201d said Dr. Kumar.\n\n\u201cNormally, women are very underrepresented in the cardamom auction-related process. We hope the new company will help attract more women farmers to the sector,\u201d said Dr. Kumar.\n\nAccording to officials, the women-owned cardamom company is presenting good-graded cardamom in the hope that it will attract vendors during the auction. \u201cThe season\u2019s highest price for cardamom per kg, \u20b93,804, was quoted during the first auction of the women-owned cardamom company. The presence of the new company already reflects positively on the price for cardamom,\u201d said an official.\n\nSujatha Bhagavathiraj, one of the company\u2019s director board members, said that talks to float the company began in 2021 during a family meeting and it has finally come into being today. \u201cWhen we approached the Spices Board to register a women-controlled cardamom auction company, the board secretary and other officials welcomed the initiative and provided all assistance in registering the company,\u201d said Ms. Bhagavathiraj.\n\n\u201cWe plan to introduce value-added cardamom products in the future. Our company\u2019s motto is not to use artificial colour in cardamom and not to support using unauthorised pesticides in cardamom plantations,\u201d she said.\n\nThe new company\u2019s first auction was held at the Puttady Spices Park on Saturday. The average price quoted was \u20b92,070 per kg. A total of 29,815 kg cardamom was on auction, and the maximum price quoted was \u20b93,804 per kg. The lowest price quoted was \u20b91,589.\n\nThe inauguration of the women-owned cardamom auction company was held at Puttady Spices Park and the Spices Board office at Bodinayakanur in Tamil Nadu. Mr. Anikumar inaugurated the company at Puttady, while Bank of India Madurai Zonal Manager Kishore Kumar and Spices Board Assistant Director Sentil Kumar jointly led the inauguration at Bodinayakanur.",

But Mr. Khan\u2019s announcement deepens Israel\u2019s isolation as it presses ahead in Gaza, and the threat of arrest could make it difficult for the Israeli leaders to travel abroad.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the chief prosecutor\u2019s decision to seek arrest warrants against Israel\u2019s leaders is \u201ca historic disgrace that will be remembered forever.\u201d\n\nHe said he would form a special committee to fight back against any such action and would work with world leaders to ensure that any such warrants are not enforced on Israel\u2019s leaders.\n\nAlso read: A brief history of starvation as a \u2018war crime\u2019 | Explained\n\nThe Hamas militant group denounced the ICC prosecutor\u2019s request to seek the arrests of its leaders.\n\nBenny Gantz, a former military chief and member of Israel\u2019s War Cabinet with Netanyahu and Gallant, harshly criticized Khan\u2019s announcement, saying Israel fights with \u201cone of the strictest\u201d moral codes, respects international law and has a robust judiciary capable of investigating itself.\n\n\u201cThe State of Israel is waging one of the just wars fought in modern history following a reprehensible massacre perpetrated by terrorist Hamas on the 7th of October,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s position to apply for arrest warrants is in itself a crime of historic proportion to be remembered for generations.\n\nOther Israeli leaders, including opposition leader Yair Lapid, also condemned the ICC prosecutor.\n\nIn a statement, Hamas accused the prosecutor of trying to \u201cequate the victim with the executioner.\u201d It said it has the right to resist Israeli occupation, including \u201carmed resistance.\u201d\n\nIt also criticized the court for seeking the arrests of only two Israeli leaders and said it should seek warrants for other Israeli leaders.\n\nBoth Sinwar and Deif are believed to be hiding in Gaza as Israel tries to hunt them down. But Haniyeh, the supreme leader of the Islamic militant group, is based in Qatar and frequently travels across the region.\n\nThe latest war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 7, when militants from Gaza crossed into Israel and killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 others hostage.\n\nThe Israeli offensive has killed over 35,000 Palestinians, at least half of them women and children, according to the latest estimates by Gaza health officials. The Israeli offensive has also triggered a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, displacing roughly 80% of the population and leaving hundreds of thousands of people on the brink of starvation, according to U.N. officials.\n\nSpeaking of the Israeli actions, Khan said in a statement that \u201cthe effects of the use of starvation as a method of warfare, together with other attacks and collective punishment against the civilian population of Gaza are acute, visible and widely known. ... They include malnutrition, dehydration, profound suffering and an increasing number of deaths among the Palestinian population, including babies, other children, and women.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations and other aid agencies have repeatedly accused Israel of hindering aid deliveries throughout the war. Israel denies this, saying there are no restrictions on aid entering Gaza and accusing the United Nations of failing to distribute aid. The U.N. says aid workers have repeatedly come under Israeli fire, and also says ongoing fighting and a security vacuum have impeded deliveries.\n\nOf the Hamas actions on Oct. 7, Khan, who visited the region in December, said that he saw for himself \u201cthe devastating scenes of these attacks and the profound impact of the unconscionable crimes charged in the applications filed today. Speaking with survivors, I heard how the love within a family, the deepest bonds between a parent and a child, were contorted to inflict unfathomable pain through calculated cruelty and extreme callousness. These acts demand accountability.\u201d\n\nAfter a brief period of international support for its war, Israel has faced increasing criticism as the war has dragged on and the death toll has climbed.\n\nIsrael is also facing a South African case in the International Court of Justice, the U.N.\u2019s top court, accusing Israel of genocide. Israel denies those charges.\n\nThe ICC was established in 2002 as the permanent court of last resort to prosecute individuals responsible for the world\u2019s most heinous atrocities \u2014 war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly endorsed the ICC, but the court is independent.\n\nDozens of countries don\u2019t accept the court\u2019s jurisdiction over war crimes, genocide and other crimes. They include Israel, the United States, Russia and China.\n\nThe ICC becomes involved when nations are unable or unwilling to prosecute crimes on their territory. Israel argues it has a functioning court system.\n\nThe ICC accepted \u201cThe State of Palestine\u201d as a member in 2015, a year after the Palestinians accepted the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nThe court\u2019s chief prosecutor at the time announced in 2021 that she was opening an investigation into possible crimes on Palestinian territory. Israel often levies accusations of bias at U.N. and international bodies, and Netanyahu condemned the decision as hypocritical and antisemitic.\n\nIn 2020, then U.S. President Donald Trump authorized economic and travel sanctions on the ICC prosecutor and another senior prosecutor. The ICC staff were looking into U.S. and allies\u2019 troops for possible war crimes in Afghanistan.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, whose administration has provided crucial military and political support for the Gaza offensive, lifted the sanctions in 2021.\n\nLast year, the court issued a warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin on charges of responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine. Russia responded by issuing its own arrest warrants for Khan and ICC judges.\n\nOther high-profile leaders charged by the court include ousted Sudanese strongman Omar al-Bashir on allegations including genocide in his country\u2019s Darfur region. Former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was captured and killed by rebels shortly after the ICC issued a warrant for his arrest on charges linked to the brutal suppression of anti-government protests in 2011.",

The Juvenile Justice Board's decision to grant the youngster bail on the same day while asking him to write an essay on road accidents has drawn criticism.\n\nThe youngster, son of a real estate developer, was drunk at the time of the accident, police claimed on May 20. A case has been registered against him under section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder ) of the Indian Penal Code and sections of the Motor Vehicles Act.\n\nA group of friends were returning on motorbikes around 3.15 am on Sunday after a party when a speeding luxury car hit one of the motorcycles at Kalyani Nagar junction. The two riders \u2014 Anis Awadhiya and Ashwini Costa \u2014 died of their injuries.\n\nThe youngster who was allegedly driving the car was produced before the Juvenile Justice Board which granted him bail.

We are now approaching the sessions court with the same plea,\" said Pune police commissioner Amitesh Kumar.\n\nHis blood report was yet to be received but preliminary probe showed that the juvenile was drunk at the time of the accident, he said.\n\n\"The CCTV footage of the bar clearly shows that the juvenile was consuming alcohol. There is no doubt that the juvenile was driving the car after consuming alcohol. We will be submitting all these facts to the court,\" commissioner Kumar said.\n\n\"We have also registered an offence against his father under the Juvenile Justice Act, and against the proprietors of the bar establishment for serving alcohol to an underage person. We have transferred the probe of these cases to the crime branch,\" he further said.\n\nPolice displayed professionalism while dealing with the case, Kumar claimed. \"The case was transferred to an ACP-level officer and it is our endeavour to make a watertight case.

If you had argued more, we would have imposed costs on you... The petition is dismissed as withdrawn,\u201d Justice Trivedi said.\n\nJustice Trivedi noted the new Acts have not come into force so far.\n\nThe petition claimed the new laws, meant to replace the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and the Evidence Act, suffered from \u201cdefects and discrepancies\u201d.\n\nThe Lok Sabha had passed the Bharatiya Nyaya (Second) Sanhita, the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha (Second) Sanhita and the Bharatiya Sakshya (Second) Bills on December 21 last year.\n\nPresident Droupadi Murmu gave her assent to the Bills on December 25.\n\nThe petition said the Bills were passed without parliamentary debate as most of the Opposition members were under suspension.\n\nThe plea had sought directions from the court for the immediate constitution of an expert committee to assess the viability of the three new criminal laws.\n\nThe three criminal laws to be effective from July 1.\n\n\u201cThe new criminal laws are far more draconian and establish a police state in reality and violate every provision of fundamental rights of the people of India. If the British laws were considered colonial and draconian, then the Indian laws stand now far more draconian as, in the British period, you could keep a person in police custody for a maximum of 15 days. Extending 15 days to 90 days and more is a shocking provision enabling police torture,\u201d the plea has said.\n\nThe Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita encompasses offences, such as acts of secession, armed rebellion, subversive activities, separatist activities or endangering the sovereignty or unity of the country, in a new avatar of the sedition law.\n\nAccording to the new laws, anyone purposely or knowingly, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, by visible representation, by electronic communication, by use of financial means, or otherwise, excites or attempts to excite secession or an armed rebellion or subversive activities, or encourages feelings of separatist activities or endangers the sovereignty or unity and integrity of India or indulges in or commits any such act shall be punished with imprisonment for life or with imprisonment that may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.\n\nAccording to Section 124A of the IPC, which deals with sedition, anyone involved in the crime may be punished with life imprisonment or with a three-year jail term. Under the new laws, \u201cRajdroh\u201d has got a new term, \u201cDeshdroh\u201d, doing away with the reference to the British crown.\n\n\u201cRajdroh\u201d refers to a rebellion or an act against the ruler, while \u201cDeshdroh\u201d represents such acts against the nation.\n\nAlso, for the first time, the word \u201cterrorism\u201d has been defined in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.

            "text": "A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on May 20 upheld the death sentence awarded by the Ernakulam Principal Sessions Court to Ameerul Islam, the lone convict in a 2016 case of rape and murder of a Dalit LLB student from Perumbavoor in Ernakulam.\n\nThe Bench comprising Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar and Justice S. Manu confirmed the verdict of the sessions court while dismissing the appeal of the convict.\n\nThe 30-year-old law student was found raped and murdered at her house at Kuruppampady near Perumbavoor on April 28, 2016. Ameerul Islam, a migrant worker from Assam, was arrested 49 days after the incident. The special investigation team had submitted a 1,500-page chargesheet on September 17, 2016 naming Islam as the lone accused.\n\nSessions court\u2019s observations\n\nWhile awarding the accused capital punishment, the sessions court had observed that the facts and circumstances of the case indicated that the crime created grave impact on social order. The gravity of the offence on society is unparalleled. When the aggravating circumstances (crime test) outweigh the mitigating ones (criminal test), the court will typically impose a sentence on the higher end of the spectrum. The balance of justice tilts in favour of the proven aggravating circumstances, the sessions court observed, adding that the brutal acts of the convict definitely fit this case within the umbrella of \u201crarest of rare cases\u201d on par with the Nirbhaya\u2019s case in Delhi.\n\nJudged by the above standards, when collective conscience of the community is so shocked, it is the duty of the court to inflict death penalty, irrespective of personal opinion as regards desirability of imposing death penalty. In the interest of justice, the law leans in accordance with the perception of society and not \u201cjudge \u2013centric.\u201d Hence, this is a fit case for awarding the death sentence to the accused, the sessions court had concluded.\n\nThe sessions court had also sentenced Ameerul Islam to life imprisonment and a fine of \u20b925,000 under Section 376A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). It also awarded him a 10-year rigorous imprisonment and a fine of \u20b925,000 under Section 376 (causing death or resulting in persistent vegetative state of victim) of the IPC.\n\nThe accused was also awarded seven-year rigorous imprisonment and one-year rigorous imprisonment and a fine of \u20b915,000 and \u20b91,000 respectively under Sections 449 (house trespass) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the IPC.\n\nThe death sentence was awarded for offence under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC.",

The surging waters swept away a 25-year-old Bihar native near Mallappally on Monday, who is yet to be traced.\n\nThe local police identified the missing man as Naresh, who had been employed at a brick manufacturing unit near Kallooppara. The person, along with two others, had ventured into the Manimala river in the evening and was swept away by the surging water. The Fire and Rescue Services has launched a search operation.\n\nThe showers which began on Saturday evening continued intermittently until late in the day. Authorities have declared a red alert for Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts until Wednesday.\n\nIn view of the weather warnings, Kottayam District Collector V. Vigneshwari has imposed a ban on night travel along the high ranges and the Erattupetta-Wagamon road on May 20 and 21. Those who have to travel through the region at night in an emergency situation should inform the police station and seek prior permission.\n\nThe water level in the Meenachil river stood at 31.798 metres at Theekoy, while that of the Manimala river was at 17.368 metres at Manimala.\n\nIn Pathanamthitta\n\nIn Pathanamthitta, District Collector S. Prem Krishnan has imposed a blanket ban on soil mining and quarrying activities until Wednesday. The ban on night travel along high-range roads, meanwhile, has been extended until May 23, in addition to kayaking and boating activities.\n\nAll five shutters of the Maniyar barrage are soon slated to open for regulating storage and water will be released at a rate of 100 cm through each gate. This may cause a rise in the water level of the Kakkattu river by 50 cm.",

Please explain why ICMR should not seek legal and administrative action against you,\u2019\u2019 it noted.\n\nIn its letter, the ICMR has listed out critical flaws with the study and says that it does not have a control group of unvaccinated individuals to prove that the side-effects are indeed associated with vaccination. Also it does not mention how frequently these adverse events were reported by the sample population to establish that they were associated with vaccination, the study tool was not consistent with the definition of \u201cadverse events of special interest\u201d that is globally accepted and lastly the responses of the participants were recorded one year after immunisation without verification of any clinical records or physician examination, increasing the chances of biased reporting.",

They shared their experiences.\n\nNagesh Hegde, development journalist and science communicator, recalled his long association with Dr. Bhat. He pointed out that despite all the progress in India, due priority was not accorded to villages.\n\n\u201cJust look at the Republic Day parade tableaux. In the beginning are those celebrating war and arms and ammunitions. At the end are villagers, farmers, handicrafts persons, and others. That shows the priority we accord to various sectors,\u201d he said. \u201cThe miseries of villagers has featured in the speeches of leaders from Indira Gandhi to Rahul Gandhi, but we seem to have done little about it. In such a situation, people like Dr. Bhat who have stayed in villages and worked for their uplift, without talking much about it, are important for us,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the book, Dr. Bhat has helped us understand their difficulties and explore solutions for them. He has brought the difficulties of building self-reliant villages, he said. He hoped the book would be translated into various languages.\n\nDr. Bhatt spoke about his early life. \u201cI got a veterinary degree and went abroad for higher studies. But I returned to India and began working for BAIF, founded by Manibhai Desai. I chose to go to villages and tried to understand the problems of villagers. I found that a small amount of care and affection towards them is returned many times over. I am the best example to demonstrate this phenomenon,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney is not the only thing important to them in life. They value relations,\u201d he said.\n\nTejaswi Kattimani, Vice-Chancellor, Central Tribal University of Andhra Pradesh, said that Dr. Bhat and his team had made a difference in the lives of 75 villages. Over 7,000 families have been involved in the transformative process.\n\n\u201cNot only this, he has set an example of how to fight drought . Over 20 lakh trees have been planted and over 50 crore litres of rainwater have been collected through various structures,\u201d Prof. Kattimani said.\n\nDhamakka Patil of Surashettikoppa, a beneficiary of the BAIF projects, spoke of how Dr. Bhat and his team transformed the village and the lives of villagers, through a well-rounded approach. \u201cWhen they first came, no one believed they could make a difference. But we soon realised their sincerity and engaged with them. They took up projects like financial management, rainwater harvesting, energy efficiency, health and hygiene, and other programmes,\u201d she said.\n\nVillagers sang songs and symbolically opened a box of rotis to mark the occasion.\n\nThinker Krishnamarthi Biligere, publisher G.N. Mohan, and others held an interaction with the writer. Questions were asked about Dr. Bhatt\u2019s idea of sustainable lifestyles, association with villagers, and others. His wife Sunanda Bhatt spoke. MLA Aravinda Bellada, former MLA D.R. Patila, writer Malathi Patnashetty, and residents of villages like Bellakki, Surashettikoppa and others participated.",

He says the number of e-vehicle buyers will double if the number of charging points are increased along rural roads.\n\nThe poor visibility of many pole-mounted charging points also continues to be an issue. Only very few mobile applications are currently in use to support the proper navigation of about 26 mapped charging points in the district. Of this, about 15 are located in the urban area. Many of the wayside charging points are rarely used by motorists due to poor visibility.\n\nE.K.

General Assembly approved its first resolution on artificial intelligence, lending support to an international effort to ensure the powerful new technology benefits all nations, respects human rights and is \u201csafe, secure and trustworthy.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. and China held their first high-level talks on artificial intelligence in Geneva to discuss how to address the risks of the fast-evolving technology and set shared standards to manage it. There, U.S. officials raised concerns about China\u2019s \u201cmisuse of AI\u201d while Chinese representatives rebuked the U.S. over \u201crestrictions and pressure\u201d on artificial intelligence, according to their governments.\n\nWhat will be discussed at the Seoul summit?\n\nThe May 21-22 meeting is co-hosted by the South Korean and U.K. governments.\n\nOn day one, Tuesday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Sunak will meet leaders virtually. A few global industry leaders have been invited to provide updates on how they\u2019ve been fulfilling the commitments made at the Bletchley summit to ensure the safety of their AI models.\n\nOn day two, digital ministers will gather for an in-person meeting hosted by South Korean Science Minister Lee Jong-ho and Britain\u2019s Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan. Participants will share best practices and concrete action plans. They also will share ideas on how to protect society from potentially negative impacts of AI on areas such as energy use, workers and the proliferation of mis- and disinformation, according to the organisers.\n\nThe meeting has been dubbed a mini virtual summit, serving as an interim meeting until Paris holds a full-fledged in-person edition later this year.\n\nThe digital ministers\u2019 meeting is to include representatives from countries like the United States, China, Germany, France and Spain and companies including ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and Anthropic.\n\nWhat progress have AI safety efforts made?\n\nThe accord reached at the U.K. meeting was light on details and didn\u2019t propose a way to regulate the development of AI.\n\n\u201cThe United States and China came to the last summit. But when we look at some principles announced after the meeting, they were similar to what had already been announced after some U.N. and OECD meetings,\u201d said Lee Seong-yeob, a professor at the Graduate School of Management of Technology at Seoul\u2019s Korea University. \"There was nothing new.\u201d\n\nIt's important to hold a global summit on AI safety issues, he said, but it will be \u201cconsiderably difficult\u201d for all participants to reach agreements since each country has different interests and different levels of domestic AI technologies and industries.\n\nThe gathering is being held as Meta, OpenAI and Google roll out the latest versions of their AI models.\n\nThe original AI Safety Summit was conceived as a venue for hashing out solutions for so-called existential risks posed by the most powerful \u201cfoundation models\u201d that underpin general purpose AI systems like ChatGPT.\n\nPioneering computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, dubbed one of the \u201cgodfathers of AI,\u201d was tapped at the U.K. meeting to lead an expert panel tasked with drafting a report on the state of AI safety. An interim version of the report released on Friday to inform discussions in Seoul identified a range of risks posed by general purpose AI, including its malicious use to increase the \u201cscale and sophistication\u201d of frauds and scams, supercharge the spread of disinformation, or create new bioweapons.\n\nMalfunctioning AI systems could spread bias in areas like healthcare, job recruitment and financial lending, while the technology's potential to automate a big range of tasks also poses systemic risks to the labor market, the report said.\n\nSouth Korea hopes to use the Seoul summit to take the initiative in formulating global governance and norms for AI. But some critics say the country lacks AI infrastructure advanced enough to play a leadership role in such governance issues.",

President Zelensky visited Kharkiv, located around 30km south of the Russia-Ukraine border, on Thursday and held meetings with officials to assess the situation in the area. \u201cOur counterattacks are ongoing, including in other parts of the Kharkiv border area,\u201d he said in a video message after the visit.\n\nThanks to Ukraine's Defense Forces and our efforts, we were able to instill more confidence in the Vochansk direction.

The region was the centre of intense fighting at the beginning of the invasion, until Ukrainian forces managed to push Russia back in May 2022. Russia, however, continued to shell the Kharkiv region, destroying critical infrastructure like thermal power plants and educational institutions.\n\nBy October 2022, Ukraine had control over most of Kharkiv oblast. Russia, however, kept up its attack for most of 2023. It renewed the offensive in the region in May 2024, and Ukraine\u2019s commander-in-chief on May 12 said the situation in Kharkiv has \u201csignificantly worsened.\u201d\n\nWhy is Kharkiv important?\n\nKharkiv is the second-largest city in Ukraine after the capital Kyiv, population-wise. It is a major industrial town in the country and is home to multiple institutes of higher education. This makes Kharkiv a significant economic asset for Ukraine. The city, and the larger oblast of which it is a part, have been repeatedly attacked by Russia since it invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensives in the region have become a symbol of the country\u2019s resistance to Russian occupation even as it remains one of Moscow\u2019s major targets.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Friday said his forces are advancing in the Kharkiv region to create a buffer zone to protect his country\u2019s border regions. However, the city of Kharkiv itself is not a part of his plan, Mr. Putin added.\n\nMr. Putin also blamed Ukraine for shelling Russia\u2019s border regions, calling it the reason for his country\u2019s renewed offensive in Kharkiv. \u201cI said publicly that if this continues, we will be forced to create a security zone, a buffer zone. That is what we are doing,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\n\nRussia has mentioned creating a \u201csanitary zone\u201d in the Kharkiv region on previous occasions, too. When Mr. Putin pledged to carve out this zone after winning the Russian presidential election in March, he did not provide specifics, but security analysts believed he could attempt to capture Kharkiv city, as per an Associated Press report.\n\n\u201cIn Russian discourse on the war, elaborated by President Putin, the matter of Ukrainian identity is central, and the denial of such identity underpins the strategic plan for the destruction of Ukraine as a major European state. Kharkiv, which is a predominantly Russian-speaking city, makes a key exhibit in such discourse - and the resolute rejection by its inhabitants of Russian plans for annexation constitutes major evidence of falsity of Putin\u2019s claims,\u201d Pavel Baev, research professor at the Peace Research Institute Oslo, told The Hindu.\n\nMr. Baev also believes that Russia\u2019s offensive in Kharkiv is aimed at distracting attention from Donbas. \u201cRussian attacks toward Kharkiv remain limited in scope and are aimed primarily at distracting Ukrainian forces from the main theatre of operations in Donbas. Despite frequent missile strikes and bombings, Kharkiv remains a major urban centre, and Russian would need a grouping of at least 150,000 troops to conduct an operation on its encirclement and capture. No such force has been gathered, and it is in fact beyond Russia\u2019s capacity to build such grouping without weakening its positions on the key strategic directions in Southern Ukraine,\u201d he said.\n\nDonetsk and Luhansk in the Donbas region are critical points of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. On February 21, 2022, days before Russia invaded Ukraine, Mr. Putin had recognised the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and also declared that he would provide them military support.\n\nSouthern Ukraine:\n\n\n\nRussian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces advanced in southern Urozhaine (south of Velyka Novosilka), and ISW assesses that Russian forces advanced in these areas given confirmed Russian advances in the surrounding area. (1/3) https://t.co/762MBwYX1Ipic.twitter.com/xzGkXURAeN \u2014 Institute for the Study of War (@TheStudyofWar) May 17, 2024\n\nWhat next?\n\nAir defence coverage in Kharkiv city area will allow Ukraine to restrict Russia\u2019s aviation operations if western countries allow Ukraine to intercept Russian aircraft in Russian airspace, since they are capable of striking Kharkiv City without ever leaving Russian airspace, the Institute for the Study of War noted. So far, Ukraine\u2019s European allies and the U.S. have prohibited Ukraine from striking targets within Russia.\n\nHowever, in his recent Ukraine visit, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it is up to Ukraine to chart its course in the war. \u201cWe have not encouraged or enabled strikes outside of Ukraine, but ultimately Ukraine has to make decisions for itself about how it\u2019s going to conduct this war, a war it\u2019s conducting in defence of its freedom, of its sovereignty, of its territorial integrity. And we will continue to back Ukraine with the equipment that it needs to succeed, that it needs to win,\u201d Mr. Blinken said in a press conference with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on May 15 in Kyiv.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)",

Altman said that OpenAI had never clawed back vested equity and said steps were being taken to fix the exit paperwork.\n\nMost ex-OpenAI employees have avoided criticising the company when exiting, but this changed when former executive Jan Leike resigned, citing his disagreement with the way OpenAI\u2019s leadership handled safety at the company.

OpenAI co-founders Altman and Greg Brockman defended the company\u2019s safety culture and responded that the latest GPT-4 products had been shipped safely to the world.\n\nEuropean Union probes Facebook and Instagram\n\nThe EU launched a fresh investigation into Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram, this time over concerns that the two apps are failing to safeguard children and are not complying with the bloc\u2019s Digital Service Act (DSA). In case Meta is deemed to have failed in its obligations, it could be fined up to 6% of its annual worldwide revenue. The EU is especially worried about Meta\u2019s recommendation engines and how they could lead to addictive behaviour in children, triggering them to watch more and more inappropriate content.\n\nThe EU\u2019s commission will probe Meta\u2019s use of age verification tools to ensure that children below the age of 13 are not accessing Facebook and Instagram. Meta has insisted that protecting children is a major priority and outlined how it is using AI to protect young users from nudity.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 17 plans in the spotlight\n\nApple is possibly investing more in the slimness of its devices, as a report from The Information outlet said that the premium gadget maker is working on a thinner version of the iPhone, and that it could be launched in September 2025 along with the iPhone 17 series models. The price of this slimmed down iPhone is expected to go beyond that of Apple\u2019s most premium iPhone Pro Max variant. The design of the device is still undergoing testing, and it could use Apple\u2019s cutting-edge A19 processor.\n\nAs customers and investors await this year\u2019s iPhone launch event, predicted to take place in the autumn, display analyst Ross Young said that the displays for the Apple iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Pro models could enter production next month.",

Rather than individual devotees, families comprising an entire clan representing their ancestral lineages take out a huge procession to the temple, preceded by folk artists beating drums and cymbals and goats taken for sacrifice.\n\nSimilarly, the annual Brahmotsavams at Sri Govindaraja Swamy temple is also in progress, where the procession of the deities is taken out twice a day on the four streets encircling the temple, which forms Tirupati\u2019s core area.\n\nAs the annual vacation season also nears its end, the summer rush to Tirumala has peaked over the last two days, making the railway station and central bus station overcrowded.\n\n\u201cOur people are observing restraint and not insisting hard on the implementation of Section 144, given the religious and cultural sensitivities,\u201d said Collector and District Election Officer Pravin Kumar, while acknowledging the challenge.",

            "publish_date": "2024-05-20",
            "text": "Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader was re-elected on May 19 for another four-year term, an endorsement of his handling of the economy and tough policies toward migration from Haiti.\n\nThe two nations share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, but the much more prosperous Dominican Republic stands in stark contrast to its poverty and gang violence-plagued neighbor.\n\nThe volatility across the border has been a key issue in the election campaign, but Mr. Abinader, 56, also boasted success in managing the economy and the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAs the number of ballots counted passed 21%, his main rival, former president Leonel Fernandez, conceded defeat and congratulated Mr. Abinader.\n\n\u201cI am and will be the president of all Dominicans,\u201d Mr. Abinader said in a speech before hundreds of supporters at his campaign Headquarters in the capital Santo Domingo.\n\n\u201cThe people have expressed themselves clearly... I accept the trust I have received and the obligation not to disappoint,\u201d Mr. Abinader said shortly after his two top rivals, including Mr. Fernandez, threw in the towel.\n\n\u201cI will not fail them,\u201d he told supporters, who chanted \u201cFour more years! Four more years!\u201d\n\nWith 25% of votes counted, Mr. Abinader was ahead with more than 59%, fully 30 points clear of Fernandez, with 27%. A win with more than 50% of the vote is required to avoid a runoff.\n\nMr. Abel Martinez was in third with 10.7%, while the other six candidates barely topped 3% of the total.\n\n\u2018Things can improve\u2019\n\nMr. Abinader is a U.S.-trained economist of Lebanese descent and multi-millionaire heir of a family tourism and construction empire.\n\nHe was elected during the Covid pandemic in 2020 on promises of restoring trust in the Government after several high-profile corruption scandals embroiling public officials in the top tourist destination.\n\nOnce in office, he began building a 164-kilometre (102-mile) concrete wall along the border with Haiti to keep out undocumented migrants.\n\nHe had more than 250,000 migrants deported in 2023.\n\nThe president enjoys domestic approval ratings of around 70% \u2014 more than when he was elected \u2014 despite international pressure for the Dominican Republic to welcome more refugees.\n\nThe migration issue has not been a divisive one in the election, with both Fernandez and Mr. Abinader backing the deportation of Haitian migrants and increased border security.\n\nSince he came to power, Mr. Abinader has increased immigration raids and multiplied deportations, built a wall on part of the border, and closed migration from Haiti.\n\nVoter Javier Taveras, 38, told AFP on election day that he \u201clikes the current position of maintaining sovereignty,\u201d though not \u201cthe abuse against our Haitian brothers.\u201d\n\nAs for the border wall, \u201cI don\u2019t know how effective it is,\u201d he said.\n\nA Gallup poll showed 47.5% of Dominicans believe the country was \u201con the right path\u201d and 40% believed the economy is doing better than before.\n\nMaria Ramona Antonio, a 74-year-old dentist, said she believes Abinader has done well and voted for his re-election.\n\n\u201cLook how tourism is going, which is the best source of work for us... the roads built, those people in need who now have health insurance,\u201d she told AFP in Santo Domingo.\n\nMr. Fernandez had accused the Government of manipulating growth data. The World Bank reports that the Dominican economy grew 2.5% in 2023.\n\n\u201cI hope for economic stability from the next government,\u201d said voter Taveras.\n\nOpinion polls also showed Mr. Abinader\u2019s Modern Revolutionary Party (PRM) bound for a majority in Congress. Experts agree that the party will fare well in elections for the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nThe party won 120 of 150 mayoral posts in February municipal elections, considered a litmus test ahead of the general vote.\n\n\u201cWe are sweeping, we are on top,\u201d voter Joney Dotel, a 38-year-old psychologist, said at the PRM Headquarters.\n\n\u201cThe country continues with change, and it is in favor of democracy.\u201d\n\nMr. Abinader rose to power on an anti-corruption platform. His minister of public works, Deligne Ascencion assured on May 19 that the elections were clean, despite complaints from opposition camps of vote-buying.\n\nThe country\u2019s electoral commission reported it has not received any formal complaint of such irregularities.",

            "text": "The story so far: As part of a multi-agency effort to locate a helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi that crashed in East Azerbaijan province on Sunday (May 19), the European Union activated its emergency satellite mapping service at Iran\u2019s request as adverse weather and darkness hampered search and rescue operations.\n\n\u201cUpon Iranian request for assistance we are activating the EU\u2019s Copernicus EMS rapid response mapping service in view of the helicopter accident reportedly carrying the President of Iran and its foreign minister,\u201d European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d said on X. \u201cThe provision of a Copernicus EMS satellite mapping upon request for facilitating a search and rescue operation is not an act of political support to any regime or establishment. It is simply an expression of the most basic humanity,\u201d Mr. Lenar\u010di\u010d later added.\n\nUpon Iranian request for assistance we are activating the \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa's @CopernicusEMS rapid response \ud83d\udce1 mapping service in view of to the helicopter accident reportedly carrying the President of #Iran and its foreign minister. #EUSolidarity \u2014 Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d (@JanezLenarcic) May 19, 2024\n\nOn Monday morning, the helicopter was found after an extensive search, with state media confirming that President Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and other officials were found dead at the crash site located near the border with Azerbaijan.\n\nEbrahim Raisi | A hardline President who had the backing of Iran\u2019s clerical establishment\n\nWhat is Europe\u2019s Copernicus programme?\n\nThe rapid response mapping technology is a critical component of the Emergency Management Service (EMS) within the Copernicus programme. Named after the renowned 15th-century scientist Nicolaus Copernicus, the programme is the earth observation component of the European Union\u2019s space initiative. Copernicus was launched in 1998, and was earlier known as the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security Programme (GMES).\n\nThe programme uses global data from satellites, and ground-based, airborne, and sea-borne measurement systems to provide environment-related information to researchers, policymakers, public authorities, international organisations, and commercial and private users to address issues related to climate change, disaster management, and agriculture, among other uses.\n\nThe space segment uses a group of satellites, called the Sentinels and the Contributing Missions. It is complemented by a ground segment which includes in-situ sensors that provide access to the Sentinels and Contributing Missions data.\n\nPresently, the programme is implemented by EU member states with the support of the European Space Agency (ESA) for the space component and the European Environment Agency (EEA) for the in-situ component. The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), EU Agencies and Mercator Oc\u00e9an, the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the Joint Research Center (JRC) also assist.\n\nNotably, data from the Copernicus programme is freely available and accessible to all.\n\nWhat is the rapid response mapping service activated to locate the Iranian President?\n\nCopernicus provides geospatial information from satellite images and other data sources to help manage a wide range of emergencies resulting from natural or man-made disasters like flood, earthquake, and tsunamis, as well as aid during humanitarian crises by monitoring refugee and internally displaced people.\n\nActive since 2012, the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) works on two models \u2014 on-demand mapping and early warning and monitoring \u2014 to issue warnings, risk assessments and information on the impact of disasters worldwide, before, during, or after a crisis.\n\nWhile on-demand mapping offers detailed information for specific emergencies, early warning provides critical geospatial data through monitoring and forecasts for floods, droughts, and forest fires. In the case of the Iranian President\u2019s helicopter crash, the EU activated the rapid response mapping service.\n\nHow does rapid mapping work?\n\nThe Copernicus EMS on-demand rapid mapping provides geospatial information within a few hours or days of a request to support efforts in the immediate aftermath of an emergency or a disaster anywhere in the world.\n\nIt acquires, processes, and analyses satellite images, geospatial data, and relevant social media in rapid mode to provide information, according to the Copernicus official website. \u201cA rapid mapping activation is defined by one event and a location. There can be more than one area of interest (AOI) in an activation but these need to be linked to the same event. AOIs represent the geographical areas to be analysed and mapped,\u201d it says.\n\nThe service offers four \u201cproducts\u201d \u2014 one pre-event reference and three post-event (first estimate, delineation, grading). Each comprises delivery packages including maps and a vector package of spatial data.\n\nOnce a rapid response mapping service is activated in case of an emergency, the \u201cFirst Estimate Product\u201d offers a fast but rough assessment of the most affected area using the earliest post-event image. \u201cDelineation\u201d assesses the extent of the impacted area and an update on the situation if requested. The information is derived from images taken soon after the emergency. \u201cGrading\u201d provides a detailed damage assessment, its spatial distribution and extent.",

The results will be declared on June 4.\n\nOn the possibility of a Cabinet reshuffle after the Lok Sabha results, the Chief Minister said there was no plan before him on that. However, the decision would be taken as per the directions of the party high command, Mr. Siddaramaiah said.\n\nSpeculations are rife in political circles that the Cabinet would be reshuffled based on the performance of the party in the Lok Sabha elections in different constituencies.\n\nEarlier, the Chief Minister spelled out the government\u2019s one-year achievements and said all the five guarantees had been implemented as promised by the party in its poll manifesto in 2023. The government would continue all the five guarantees for the full five-year term. \u201cThere is no question of stopping them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe government had stated that close to 4.6 crore people had been receiving benefits under the guarantees. Each family had been receiving benefits of \u20b960,000 per year.\n\nUnder the Shakti programme, women had been travelling for free in government buses to pilgrimage centres and also for visiting relatives. The government had been crediting each woman head of the households \u20b92,000 per month under the Gruha Lakshmi scheme and many women used the money to purchase gold, refrigerators, ceiling fans, and other household items, the Chief Minister said.\n\nA sum of \u20b936,000 crore had been spent on these schemes in 2023-24 and \u20b952,000 crore had been allocated in 2024-25 in the State Budget for them, he pointed out. No development work had been stalled as alleged by the BJP and JD (S), he claimed.\n\nMuslim quota\n\nOn the allegation that the State government had taken away some percentage of reservation from OBCs and given it to Muslims, he said Muslims had been given 4 per cent reservation in government jobs and admissions in educational institutions based on the Chinnappa Reddy Commission recommendations since 1994.\n\nThe Basavaraj Bommai government had withdrawn the reservation given to Muslims to increase the quota of Lingayats and Vokkaligas. But the Bommai government in an affidavit in the Supreme Court maintained that it had not scrapped the reservation for Muslims. The Muslim quota (4%) continued in the State, he said.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi had been levelling false charges against the Congress government on providing quota for Muslims to secure votes of the Hindus, Mr. Siddaramaiah charged.",

            "text": "Iran's first Vice President Mohammad Mokhber was appointed as acting President of the Islamic Republic on May 20 after the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in the country's northwest.\n\nMr. Mokhber, 68, largely has been in the shadows compared to other politicians in Iran's Shia theocracy. Raisi's death under the constitution thrust Mr. Mokhber into public view. He is expected to serve as caretaker President for some 50 days before mandatory presidential elections in Iran.\n\nIran\u2019s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made the announcement of Mr. Mokhber\u2019s appointment in a condolence message he shared for Raisi\u2019s death in the crash on May 19. The helicopter was found on May 20 in northwestern Iran.\n\nDespite his low-key public profile, Mr. Mokhber has held prominent positions with in the country's power structure, particularly in its bonyads, or charitable foundations. Those groups were fuelled by donations or assets seized after Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution, particularly those previously associated with Iran's shah or those in his government.\n\nIran helicopter crash LIVE Updates\n\nMr. Mokhber oversaw a bonyad known in English as the Execution of Imam Khomeini's Order, or EIKO, referring to the late Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury said the organization oversaw billions of dollars in assets as \u201ca business juggernaut under the direct supervision of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei that has a stake in nearly every sector of the Iranian economy, including energy, telecommunications, and financial services.\u201d\n\n\u201cEIKO has systematically violated the rights of dissidents by confiscating land and property from opponents of the regime, including political opponents, religious minorities, and exiled Iranians,\u201d the Treasury said in 2021 in sanctioning Mokhber. The European Union also had sanctioned Mokhber for a time with others over concerns then about Iran's nuclear program.\n\nAs the head of EIKO, Mr. Mokhber oversaw an effort to make a COVID-19 vaccine during the height of the pandemic, pledging to make tens of millions of doses. Only a fraction of that ever made it to the public, without explanation.\n\nMr. Mokhber previously worked in banking and telecommunications. He also worked at the Mostazafan Foundation, another bonyad that's a major conglomerate that manages the country\u2019s mega-projects and businesses. While there, he found himself entangled in a bitter legal dispute between mobile phone service providers Turkcell and South Africa's MTN over potentially entering the Iranian market.\n\nMTN ended up entering Iran. A Turkcell filing alleged Mokhber sought MTN's help in securing \u201ccertain defense equipment\u201d in exchange for potentially working with it as opposed to Turkcell.\n\nMr. Mokhber used \u201cimproper influence up to and including negotiating with and on behalf of the Supreme Leader in MTN\u2019s favor,\u201d Turkcell later alleged in a legal filing. An MTN report later said there were no arms transfers, though it acknowledge Mokhber was a player in Iran's decision to go with MTN.\n\nIranian media reports suggest Mr. Mokhber, who holds a doctorate in international law, was crucial in Iranian efforts to bypass Western sanctions on its oil industry.\n\nMr. Mokhber has been a member of Iran\u2019s Expediency Council since 2022, which advises the supreme leader, as well as settles disputes between parliament and the Guardian Council, Iran\u2019s constitutional watchdog that also oversees the country\u2019s elections.\n\nMr. Mokhber was born Sept. 1, 1955, in Dezful in Iran's southwestern Khuzestan province to a clerical family. He served as an officer in the Revolutionary Guard's medical corps during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, according to the pressure group United Against Nuclear Iran.\n\n\u201cMokhber used the vast wealth accumulated by EIKO \u2014 at the expense of the Iranian people\u2014to reward regime insiders like himself,\u201d UANI said. \u201cManaging the patronage network endeared him to the supreme leader, but at a cost.\u201d",

In the outgoing House, BJP has 29 members besides one independent backed by it, from Karnataka.\n\nEven in eastern India, \u201cwe are witnessing a massive surge of support from the people \u2026 which is giving sleepless nights to people in sections of the media and politics in Bhubaneswar, Kolkata and even in Delhi,\u201d Mr. Modi said.\n\n\u201cThe blessings of the people will take us to a record-breaking mandate. We will see more seats from all parts of the country, particularly from the south and the east,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cNDA is on course to achieve the 400 seats.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll assessments of the past phases of the elections show that the NDA is in pole position and the Congress along with its INDI alliance is struggling to even open its account in some states.\u201d\n\nMr. Modi said the BJP has been a truly national party \u201cfrom Day 1, not only in our geographical presence but also in our ideology.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor us, nation first is the foundation of our ideology. If we take decisions for Bengal or Kerala it will be on the basis of nation first,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked about the national results, he said: \u201cWe have set out to cross 400. After four phases of elections, I can say with confidence that our estimate was correct, and more than our estimate the determination of people (janata Janardhan) was stronger.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister said the narrative about BJP\u2019s weakness in the south is part of a campaign that has painted the party variously as urban centric, male centric, north centric and a \u201cBaniya-Brahmin\u201d party.\n\n\u201cA myth has been spread. There is an ecosystem in our nation for years that creates all kinds of myths, to mislead the nation and to destroy the nation,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt was also said that we are a Baniya Brahmin party. But the largest number of Dalit, OBC and tribal MP/MLAs are from BJP. They do this deliberately, and a similar myth has been spread that we are not present in the south.\u201d",

            "text": "Opposition parties asked the government to focus on the maintenance of river canals from both Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts, as repairs needed to be taken up in the summer season. According to them, the government failed to concentrate on the maintenance of canals for the smooth flow of water from irrigation projects to fields, including the tail end areas. The farmers lost crops worth crores in the last couple of years with the insufficient supply of water from Thotapalli, Vamsadhara canals.\n\nVamsadhara project, which was supposed to provide water for nearly 62,280 acres in 165 villages of Srikakulam district, is unable to supply it to even 40,000 acres due to the poor maintenance of canals in Pathapatnam, Amadalavalasa, Srikakulam and other areas. The actual utilisation has to be 7.353 thousand million cubics (tmc), but it was said to be below 5 tmcs.\n\nSrikakulam Congress Committee president and Srikakulam MP candidate Pedada Parameswara Rao alleged that at least \u20b9500 crore was needed for repairs and maintenance of all canals, as the government had completely ignored repairs. \u201cThe irrigation department should take up temporary measures ahead of rainy season. Then only the farmers would come back to agriculture activity,\u201d said Mr. Parameswara Rao.\n\nTelugu Desam Party (TDP) Vizianagaram MP candidate Kalisetti Appala Naidu said that proper maintenance of tanks and protection from encroachments had to be given top priority, since 80 percent of the people depended on agriculture activity, both in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts.\n\nFormer Minister and Cheepurupalli TDP candidate Kala Venkata Rao said that \u20b9500 crore worth crop was lost in the constituency in 2023-24, as the government had failed to concentrate on irrigation. He said that optimum utilisation of water of Nagavali, Champavati, Vegavati and other rivers would ensure three crops in a year for farmers.",

Later, three bejewelled women from the palace including Devajammanni had posed for a painting.\n\nThe post card released by the Department of Posts on Monday shows the portrait of Devajammani from the historic painting\n\nMr. Rangaraju said there was widespread suspicion and resistance to vaccination in the early 19th century when the vaccination for smallpox was new. \u201cWomen particularly did not wish to show their arms to \u201cwhite-skinned\u201d people,\u201d he said. Hence, the then Maharani had to take the lead. However, when people recovered from the post-vaccination fever after three days, they formed queues to undergo vaccination.\n\nThe Department of Posts described Devajammani as the one, \u201cwho inspired the immunization drive against small pox\u201d.\n\n\u201cHer unwitting role was captured in a painting commissioned by the East India Company to encourage participation in the vaccination drive,\u201d the Department of Posts said.",
