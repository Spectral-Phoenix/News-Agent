            "publish_date": "2024-05-31",
            "text": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on May 31 said the Modi Government has turned around the banking sector through various reforms and improved governance which has led to banks recovering more than \u20b910 lakh crore from bad loans between 2014 and 2023.\n\nShe said the Enforcement Directorate has investigated around 1,105 bank fraud cases, which resulted in the attachment of \u20b964,920 crore worth of proceeds of crime. As of December 2023, assets amounting to \u20b915,183 crore have been restituted to the Public Sector Banks (PSBs).\n\n\"Recently, India's banking sector achieved a significant milestone by recording its highest-ever net profit, crossing \u20b93 lakh crore. The banking sector turned around due to PM Shri @narendramodi's strong and decisive leadership. Our government atoned for the UPA's sins in the banking sector through comprehensive and long-term reforms,\" Ms. Sitharaman said in a post on X. She said there was no leniency in recovering bad loans, especially from large defaulters, and the process is ongoing.\n\nShe said, \u201cThis is in stark contrast to the situation before 2014 when the Congress-led UPA government turned the banking sector into a cesspool of bad loans, vested interests, corruption and mismanagement.\u201d\n\nThe Banking sector is considered the backbone of a nation's economy. Recently, India's banking sector achieved a significant milestone by recording its highest-ever net profit, crossing \u20b9 3 lakh crores.\n\n\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the situation before 2014 when @INCIndia-led\u2026 \u2014 Nirmala Sitharaman (Modi Ka Parivar) (@nsitharaman) May 31, 2024\n\n\"It's a pity that Opposition leaders are still unable to distinguish between write-offs and waivers. After the 'write-offs' as per RBI's guidelines, banks actively pursue the recovery of bad loans. And, there has been no 'waiver ' of loans for any industrialist. Between 2014 and 2023, banks recovered more than \u20b910 lakh crore from bad loans,\" she said.\n\n\"Under the UPA, obtaining loans from banks often depended on powerful connections rather than a solid business proposition. Banks were forced to neglect proper due diligence and risk assessment before sanctioning these loans,\" she said.\n\nReforming the banking sector\n\nMs. Sitharaman said the Modi government implemented a comprehensive 4R strategy of Recognising NPAs transparently, Resolution and Recovery, Recapitalising PSBs, and Reforms after coming to power in 2014. \"Our reforms addressed credit discipline, recognition and resolution of stress, responsible lending and improved governance. We replaced political interference in banks with professional integrity and independence,\" she said.\n\nThe minister said the Modi government will continue to take decisive measures to strengthen and stabilise our banking system, ensuring banks support India's growth path to Viksit Bharat by 2047.\n\nEfforts to expand banking in India faltered for decades due to Congress's limited actions beyond bank nationalisation, which benefitted mainly the educated and elite. Before 2014, banking access was largely restricted to cities, she said. \"We remain committed to further driving financial inclusion and empowering the underprivileged,\" Sitharaman said.",

            "text": "The U.S. and Chinese defence chiefs held rare direct talks in Singapore on May 31, offering hopes for more military dialogue that could help prevent disputes over Taiwan and other flashpoint issues from spinning out of control.\n\nThe meeting between the United States\u2019 Lloyd Austin and China\u2019s Dong Jun on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue is the first substantive face-to-face talks between the two countries\u2019 defence chiefs in 18 months.\n\nRestoring military-to-military dialogue\n\nThe United States and China will resume military-to-military communications \u201cin the coming months\u201d, Mr. Lloyd Austin said, as Beijing hailed the \u201cstabilising\u201d security relations between the countries.\n\nMr. Austin said telephone conversations between US and Chinese military commanders would resume \u201cin the coming months\u201d, according to a readout released by the Pentagon. He also welcomed plans for a \u201ccrisis-communications working group\u201d with China by the end of the year, the statement said.\n\nDescribing the talks as \u201cpositive\u201d, Chinese defence spokesman Wu Qian told reporters that military-to-military relations were \u201ccurrently stopping their decline and stabilising\u201d. Mr. Wu cautioned that it was not possible for Beijing and Washington to solve all bilateral problems in one meeting, but said \u201ctalking is better than not talking\u201d.\n\nRising tensions between U.S.,China\n\nDefence chiefs and officials from around the world are attending the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual forum that has in recent years become a barometer of U.S.-China relations.\n\nThis year's edition comes a week after China held military drills around Taiwan and warned of war over the U.S.-backed island following the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te, who Beijing has described as a \"dangerous separatist\".\n\nThe dispute over democratic Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory, tops the list of disputes between the rivals.\n\nBeijing is also furious over Washington's deepening defence ties in the Asia-Pacific, particularly with the Philippines, and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nChina views this as part of a decades-long U.S. effort to contain it.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration and China have been stepping up communication to ease friction between the nuclear-armed rivals, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting Beijing and Shanghai last month. A key focus has been the resumption of military-to-military dialogue.\n\nChina scrapped military communications with the United States in 2022 in response to then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan.\n\nTensions between Washington and Beijing were stoked further during 2023 by issues including an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over U.S. airspace, a meeting between Taiwan's then-president Tsai Ing-wen and Pelosi's successor Kevin McCarthy, and American military aid for Taipei.\n\nThe two sides agreed after a summit between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Biden in November last year to restart high-level military talks.\n\nThat includes a communications channel between the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command chief and Chinese commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea.\n\nChinese and American forces have had a series of close encounters in the disputed waterway that China claims almost entirely.\n\nEditorial | Competition and conflict: On the U.S.-China relationship\n\nMr. Austin warned before Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi agreed to resume military-to-military dialogue that accidents have the potential to spiral out of control, especially in the absence of open lines of communication between American and Chinese forces.\n\nFriday's meeting between Mr. Austin and Mr. Dong follows a phone call between the pair in April, and offers hope of further military talks to cool tensions. The two leaders will give speeches this weekend at the Shangri-La Dialogue in which they are expected to touch on a range of their nations' pressure points.\n\nIndo-Pacific in focus\n\nThe U.S., increasingly worried about China's fast-developing military capabilities, has been strengthening its alliances and partnerships in the region to counter China's growing assertiveness over Taiwan and in the South China Sea.\n\nIn a post on X early on Friday announcing his arrival in Singapore, Mr. Austin said he would meet with regional counterparts and continue his department's work with \"like-minded Indo-Pacific partners to promote our shared vision for a free and open region\".\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who has sought to deepen defence cooperation with the United States as he stands up to Chinese actions in waters off the Southeast Asia country, will deliver the Shangri-La Dialogue's keynote speech on Friday.\n\n---",

            "title": "The transformative impact of gold loans on Indian households",
            "publish_date": "2024-05-31",
            "text": "Shripad Jadhav\n\n\u201cThe desire of gold is not for gold. It is for the means of freedom and benefit.\u201d\n\nPoet Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2019s astute reference to mankind\u2019s eternal yearning for the yellow metal perhaps summarises the mood of Indians these days. The financial freedom offered by gold, the eternal haven, and its ability to fulfil immediate desires are increasingly driving Indian households to seek loans against their precious metal.\n\nBe it farmers in rural areas, working women in urban areas, elderly seeking temporary finance or MSME entrepreneurs looking for quick working capital, gold loans are satisfying everyone\u2019s needs and aspirations.\n\nGold\u2019s intrinsic worth tends to withstand economic fluctuations, making it a reliable asset for both borrowers and lenders. According to a report by the World Gold Council, Indian households have a record gold reserve of 24,000 tonnes, and even a small percentage of it coming into the formal economy can add significant value to the economy.\n\nIndian women who hold gold as a key part of their cherished savings and investments can also utilise the power of the metal to fulfil their entrepreneurial ambitions. While urban women are comparatively advantaged in terms of financial prowess, women in rural areas can creatively use gold to source funds to improve their livelihood and income levels. Here, gold loans can empower women entrepreneurs with easier means to access capital for starting or expanding their businesses, with a lot more flexibility.\n\nWhether it is setting up small-scale enterprises such as making papad, tailoring units, dairy farming or handicrafts, women can leverage gold loans to pursue their entrepreneurial aspirations or invest in their children\u2019s education, adding much value to the household income as well as the family\u2019s future.\n\nRural India has been fancying gold for generations. As per the latest data, rural areas account for almost 60% of the total consumption of the yellow metal, which is considered the most trusted asset and a succour in times of financial crises. In this context, gold loans have emerged as a powerful instrument for empowering rural economies across India. By leveraging the intrinsic value of gold assets, these loans provide much-needed liquidity, stimulate entrepreneurship, and contribute to overall community development. However, many rural areas of the country still continue to deal with unorganised and unregulated gold loan providers including loan sharks, losing their precious gold in the process.\n\nIdeally seen, gold loans are a quick and reliable option that can enable farmers to increase the productivity and the value addition of their agricultural assets. By using gold as collateral, farmers can access cost-efficient funds for purchasing seeds, fertilizers, machinery, and other inputs necessary for farming operations. By leveraging their gold holdings, farmers can enhance yield, improve profitability, and diversify their agricultural activities, utilising modern farming techniques and implements thereby lessening their vulnerability to distress sale of the produce and improving their cash inflows.\n\nPreserving wealth\n\nGold holds immense cultural and social significance in Indian society, often passed down through generations as heirlooms or part of religious rituals and ceremonies. There is an emotional connection and ancestral affinity. No wonder, Indian families are believed to be holding the largest private stash of the yellow metal in the world\u2014valued at a staggering $2 trillion. Gold loans are designed with such sensibilities, allowing individuals to retain the ownership of the gold assets while providing them with much-needed liquidity when needed. This ensures that the cultural heritage embedded in gold is preserved and passed on to future generations even as it provides a source of financial security and empowerment for rural households .\n\nFurther, one of the key features of gold loans is the flexibility in repayment options. Borrowers can choose repayment schedules that align with their cash flow cycles, making it easier to manage debt obligations without undue strain. This flexibility ensures that borrowers can repay their loans comfortably, reducing the risk of default and fostering a culture of responsible borrowing and lending.\n\nAlso, the transformative impact of gold loans extends beyond individual borrowers to the broader community. As businesses thrive and incomes rise, local economies experience a ripple effect of economic growth and development. Increased economic activity leads to job creation, improved infrastructure, and enhanced standards of living for rural residents. Gold loans thus play a vital role in catalyzing community development and fostering inclusive growth across rural India.\n\nAnd in times of economic crises, rural communities often become the most vulnerable, facing challenges such as crop failures, rising debt, and reduced income opportunities. In such junctures, gold loans offer a source of stability and resilience, providing individuals and businesses with the financial resources needed to weather the storm. By tapping into their gold assets, rural households can withstand economic shocks, sustain their livelihoods, and emerge stronger from adversity.\n\nIn toto, gold loans have emerged as a transformative tool for economies like India, providing the much-needed liquidity, stimulating entrepreneurship, and fostering community. Given our vast reserves, the potential is too significant to ignore; Indian households which account for 27000 tonnes gold (14% of the world\u2019s holding) have only pledged around 5,300 tonnes. According to a CIBIL survey in December 2023, the gold loan industry\u2019s advances stand at \u20b97.15 lakh crore, having grown at a CAGR of 19% for the last three years.\n\nGiven the freedom and benefits that gold loans offer, Indian households may find it as the right product to meet those innate desires and aspirations.\n\n(The writer is President, Retail Agriculture and Gold Loans, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.)",

            "text": "A New Mexico judge on Thursday granted Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s request to be dropped from a lawsuit that alleges his company has failed to protect young users from exposure to child sexual abuse material.\n\nThe case is one of many filed by states, school districts and parents against Meta and its social media platforms over concerns about child exploitation.\n\nBeyond courtrooms around the U.S., the issue has been a topic of congressional hearings as lawmakers and parents are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of social media on young people\u2019s lives.\n\nJudge Bryan Biedscheid said he wasn't persuaded by the state's arguments that Zuckerberg should remain a party to the New Mexico lawsuit, but he noted that could change depending on what evidence is presented as the case against Meta proceeds.\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\nTorrez's office said it will continue to assess whether Zuckerberg should be named individually in the future.\n\nAttorneys for Meta had argued during the hearing that prosecutors would not be able to establish that the company had specifically directed its activities to New Mexico residents, meaning there would be personal jurisdiction for which the company could be held liable. They said the platforms are available worldwide and that users agree to the terms of service when signing up.\n\nThe judge disagreed, dismissing the company's motion to dismiss the state's claims.\n\nProsecutors told the judge that New Mexico is not seeking to hold Meta accountable for its content but rather its role in pushing out that content through complex algorithms that proliferate material that can be sensational, addictive and harmful.\n\nThe design features and how people interact with them are the issue, said Serena Wheaton, an assistant attorney general in the consumer protection division.\n\nEarlier this month, Torrez announced charges against three men who were accused of using Meta\u2019s social media platforms to target and solicit sex with underage children. The arrests were the result of a monthslong undercover operation in which the suspects connected with decoy accounts set up by the state Department of Justice.\n\nThat investigation began in December around the time the state filed its lawsuit against the company.\n\nAt the time of the arrests, Torrez placed blame on Meta executives \u2014 including Zuckerberg \u2014 and suggested that the company was putting profits above the interests of parents and children.\n\nMeta has disputed those allegations, saying it uses technology to prevent suspicious adults from finding or interacting with children and teens on its apps and that it works with law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting offenders.\n\nAs part of New Mexico's lawsuit, prosecutors say they have uncovered internal documents in which Meta employees estimate about 100,000 children every day are subjected to sexual harassment on the company\u2019s platforms.",

            "text": "A former speaker of Iran's parliament registered on May 31 as a possible candidate in the Islamic Republic's June 28 presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash earlier this month with seven others.\n\nAli Larijani is the first high-profile candidate to register for the contest. He and other serious contenders against Raisi had been barred from running in the 2021 election.\n\nMr. Larijani, 66, is viewed as a conservative within Iran's narrow political scene. However, he has increasingly allied himself with former President Hassan Rouhani, whose administration reached a 2015 nuclear deal with a group of world powers.\n\nHe had positioned himself as a pragmatic candidate in the 2021 vote in which hard-liner Raisi, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was elected.\n\nMr. Larijani had posted online and made comments in recent days all but confirming he would be a candidate. The Larijani family has long been powerful in Iran's Shiite theocracy.\n\n\u201cSolving the issue of sanctions for an economic opening will be among the priorities of diplomacy\u201d for Iran, he told journalists.\n\nAll candidates must be approved by Iran\u2019s 12-member Guardian Council, a panel of clerics and jurists ultimately overseen by Mr. Khamenei. That panel has never accepted a woman or anyone calling for radical change within the country\u2019s governance.\n\nWho will run?\n\nWho will run \u2014 and potentially be accepted \u2014 remains in question. The country\u2019s acting president, Mohammad Mokhber, a previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat, could be a front-runner because he has already been seen meeting with Mr. Khamenei.\n\nAlso discussed as possible aspirants are former hard-line President Mohammad Ahmadinejad and former reformist President Mohammad Khatami, but whether they would be allowed to run is another question.\n\nThe five-day registration period will close on June 4. The Guardian Council is then expected to issue its final list of candidates within 10 days. That will allow for a shortened two-week campaign before the vote in late June.\n\nChallenges ahead for the new president\n\nThe new president will take office while the country is enriching uranium at nearly weapons-grade levels and is hampering international inspections.\n\nIran has armed Russia in its war on Ukraine and launched a drone and missile attack on Israel during the war in Gaza. It also has continued arming proxy groups in the Middle East such as Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militia.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran\u2019s economy has faced years of hardship over its collapsing rial currency. Widespread protests have swept the country, most recently over the death of Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody in September 2022 after being detained for allegedly violating Iran\u2019s mandatory headscarf law.\n\nA U.N. panel said the Iranian government is responsible for the \u201cphysical violence\u201d that led to Amini\u2019s death.",

The CPEC was launched a decade ago and several projects related to energy and infrastructure had been already completed.\n\nThe Prime Minister chaired a meeting in Islamabad on Friday on his upcoming China visit directed to prepare an action plan to encourage Chinese companies to set up industries in Pakistan, assuring that Pakistan will provide all possible facilities to Chinese industrialists and investors.\n\nRadio Pakistan reported that a detailed briefing was given to the Prime Minister on the preparations for his visit to China, during which a delegation of industrialists, investors and entrepreneurs from Pakistan will also accompany him during his visit to Chinese city Shenzhen.\n\nThe delegation will meet the Chinese business community and discuss the promotion of business-to-business relations between the two countries.\n\nThe Prime Minister directed to formulate a comprehensive plan regarding productive business-to-business meetings between the two countries during his visit to China. He also directed the Pakistani Ambassador to China to provide all possible facilities to the Pakistani business delegation in China.\n\nMeanwhile, The Express Tribune reported that the government approved the construction of another road project under the CPEC at a cost of $2 billion, paving the way for the signing of its framework agreement during Prime Minister Sharif\u2019s visit to Beijing.\n\nThe Central Development Working Party (CDWP), the body mandated to recommend mega schemes for higher forum approval, sanctioned the construction of the Thakot-Raikot 241-kilometre section of the Karakoram Highway, according to an announcement by the Ministry of Planning after the meeting.\n\nThe CDWP approved the project at a cost of Rs.567.5 billion (Pakistani Rupee) ($2 billion), with the direction that the price tag should be further reduced by rationalising overhead expenses.\n\nThe Karakoram Highway was originally built with the help of China about 50 years ago, and due to the difficult terrain, scores of people died during the construction phase.\n\nA fully functional all-weather Karakoram Highway is critical for China-Pakistan economic and commercial relations. This is the third major road infrastructure project both nations aim to build under CPEC, following the Multan-Sukkur motorway and the Havelian-Thakot section of the Karakoram Highway.\n\nThe Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, Jehanzeb Khan, chaired the CDWP meeting. Mr. Khan\u2019s position in the government may further be strengthened after the budget due to certain administrative changes that Prime Minister Sharif's government is considering implementing.\n\nPakistan and China have already agreed to complete the remaining missing link of more than 800 kilometres of the Karakoram Highway during the 10th Joint Cooperation Committee meeting. \u201cThe 241-kilometre missing link is planned to be constructed with a Chinese soft loan,\u201d according to Ministry of Planning officials.\n\nOut of the $28 billion investment under CPEC, so far, $6.7 billion has been made in infrastructure projects. Last week, Pakistan requested Beijing to fund nine more projects under CPEC worth $17 billion, including the road missing link.\n\nIf China agrees to finance the project, it will be completed on an engineering procurement and construction modality, and the approval of the federal Cabinet will also be required. There were also issues with financing the project from the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), as the National Highway Authority\u2019s financing requirements for ongoing projects have already gone up to Rs.1.7 trillion.\n\nThe country also needs Rs.250 billion annually if it wishes to complete the Mainline-I project of CPEC in the next eight years.",

Parts of Bihar are voting in the final round of polling on June 1.\n\nThe deaths of 10 people were also reported in the government hospital in Odisha\u2019s Rourkela on the same day, authorities told Reuters, prompting the Odisha government to advise against outdoor activities between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. when temperatures peak.\n\nThree people died of suspected heatstroke in Jharkhand, local media reported.\n\nIndia\u2019s neighbour Pakistan has also seen a spike in forest fires as temperatures soar, going as high as 52.2\u00b0C last week.\n\nCyclone Remal batters Assam, Manipur\n\nWhile heat is affecting some parts of the country, Manipur and Assam have been battered by heavy rainfall after Cyclone Remal, with several areas inundated on May 31.\n\nThe IMD has said that isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall is very likely over Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Meghalaya, parts of West Bengal and Sikkim over the next five days.\n\nIt has also predicted isolated heavy rainfall over Kerala, Mahe, Andaman & Nicobar Islands between May 31 and June 2. Tamil Nadu, and parts of Karnataka could witness on June 1 and June 2, the IMD observed.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)",

            "text": "Donald Trump, the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime, will remain a free man while he awaits sentencing and could avoid a prison term entirely for falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star. Here is a look at what\u2019s next for the Republican candidate for President against Democratic President Joe Biden in a November 5 election.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nThe judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, must first approve the verdict and enter a final judgment, though this is typically a formality.\n\nCriminal defendants in New York are typically sentenced within several weeks of conviction, but post-verdict legal wrangling can sometimes lead to months of delays. In the meantime, lawyers and prosecutors will recommend sentences and then argue over them at Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing, where Merchan will make a decision.\n\nWill Trump go to prison?\n\nThat is unlikely.\n\nThe maximum sentence for Mr. Trump\u2019s crime of falsifying business records is 1-1/3 to four years in prison.\n\nIt is rare for people with no criminal history who are convicted only of falsification of business records to be sentenced to prison in New York. Punishments like fines or probation are more common.\n\nDefendants convicted of falsifying business records who get sentenced to time behind bars typically serve a year or less, and even in those cases most were convicted of other crimes such as fraud or grand larceny \u2014 unlike Mr. Trump\n\nIf punished beyond a fine, Mr. Trump could be placed under home confinement or subject to a curfew rather than imprisoned.\n\nAs a former President, he has a lifetime Secret Service detail, and the logistics of keeping him safe behind bars could be complicated.\n\nMr. Trump could also be released on bail while appealing his conviction.\n\nCan Trump appeal the conviction?\n\nYes. Mr. Trump is likely to make arguments that Merchan rejected ahead of trial, including that the indictment is legally flawed and politically motivated. He is also likely to argue Merchan deprived him of a fair trial by making legal errors, including allowing salacious testimony by a porn star who said she had sex with Mr. Trump \u2014 testimony his lawyers said was gratuitous and aimed at inflaming the jury against him.\n\nThe defense is likely to argue that the charges themselves were legally improper. Falsifying business records on its own is a misdemeanor in New York, but is elevated to a felony when done to help commit or conceal another crime. In this case, Bragg's office said that other crime was a conspiracy to violate a state election law.\n\nBut Mr. Trump's lawyers have argued that state law does not apply to federal elections.\n\nCould Trump still be President?\n\nYes. The U.S. Constitution only requires that presidents be at least 35 years old and natural-born U.S. citizens who have lived in the country for 14 years.\n\nIn theory, Trump could be sworn in from jail or prison on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 2025, if he were to unseat Biden.",

            "publish_date": "2024-05-31",
            "text": "TikTok is working on a clone of its recommendation algorithm for its 170 million U.S. users that may result in a version that operates independently of its Chinese parent and be more palatable to American lawmakers who want to ban it, according to sources with direct knowledge of the efforts.\n\nThe work on splitting the source code ordered by TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent ByteDance late last year predated a bill to force a sale of TikTok's U.S. operations that began gaining steam in Congress this year. The bill was signed into law in April.\n\nThe sources, who were granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the short-form video sharing app, said that once the code is split, it could lay the groundwork for a divestiture of the U.S. assets, although there are no current plans to do so.\n\nThe company has previously said it had no plans to sell the U.S. assets and such a move would be impossible. TikTok initially declined to comment. After publication of this story, TikTok in a posting on X said \"The Reuters story published today is misleading and factually inaccurate,\" without specifying what was inaccurate.\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\nTikTok also posted a passage from its federal lawsuit: \"the 'qualified divestiture' demanded by the Act to allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\n\nAnd certainly not on the 270-day timeline required by the Act.\" \"We stand by our reporting,\" a Reuters spokesperson said. TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance sued in U.S. federal court in May, seeking to block the law forcing a sale or ban of the app by Jan. 19. A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday set a fast-track schedule to consider the legal challenges to the new law.\n\nMILLIONS OF LINES OF CODE\n\nIn the past few months, hundreds of ByteDance and TikTok engineers in both the U.S. and China were ordered to begin separating millions of lines of code, sifting through the company\u2019s algorithm that pairs users with videos to their liking.\n\nThe engineers\u2019 mission is to create a separate code base that is independent of systems used by ByteDance\u2019s Chinese version of TikTok, Douyin, while eliminating any information linking to Chinese users, two sources with direct knowledge of the project told Reuters.\n\nThe previously unreported plan provides a rare look into what a technical separation of TikTok's U.S. operations could be like, and shows to what lengths TikTok will go to address the bipartisan political risk it faces. U.S. President Biden and other supporters of the law argue TikTok gives Beijing far too much access to reams of data, information that could be used to spy on or influence TikTok\u2019s U.S. users.\n\nReuters previously reported that a sale of the app with algorithms is highly unlikely. The Chinese government in 2020 added content recommendation algorithms to its export-control list, requiring a divestiture or sale of TikTok's algorithm to go through its administrative licensing procedures. The source code for TikTok\u2019s recommendation engine was originally developed by ByteDance engineers in China, and customized for operations in TikTok\u2019s various global markets, including the U.S., according to a legal filing.\n\nByteDance has attributed TikTok\u2019s popularity to the effectiveness of its recommendation engine, which bases each user\u2019s content feeds on how they interact with the content they watch.\n\n'OPEN SOURCE'\n\nThe complexity of the task that the sources described to Reuters as tedious \u201cdirty work\u201d underscores the difficulty of splitting the underlying code that binds TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations to its Chinese parent. The work is expected to take over a year to complete, these sources said.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance have vowed to battle the U.S. law in court on First Amendment grounds. Nevertheless, engineers continue to operate under orders to disentangle TikTok\u2019s U.S. recommendation engine from ByteDance\u2019s broader network, the sources said.\n\nAn earlier plan to silo off U.S. user data, called Project Texas, failed to appease U.S. regulators and lawmakers. Now the company is seeking to escalate its efforts to show its U.S. operations are independent of its Chinese owner.\n\nAt one point, TikTok executives considered open sourcing some of TikTok's algorithm, or making it available to others to access and modify, to demonstrate technological transparency, the sources said.\n\nExecutives have communicated plans and provided updates on the code-splitting project during a team all-hands, in internal planning documents and on its internal communications system, called Lark, according to one of the sources who attended the meeting and another source who has viewed the messages.\n\nReuters could not independently verify internal messages.\n\nCompliance and legal issues involved with determining what parts of the code can be carried over to TikTok are complicating the work, according to one source. Each line of code has to be reviewed to determine if it can go into the separate code base, the sources added.\n\nThe goal is to create a new source code repository for a recommendation algorithm serving only TikTok U.S. Once completed, TikTok U.S. will run and maintain its recommendation algorithm independent of TikTok apps in other regions and its Chinese version Douyin.\n\nThat move would cut it off from the massive engineering development power of its parent company in Beijing, the sources said.\n\nIf TikTok completes the work to split the recommendation engine from its Chinese counterpart, TikTok management is aware of the risk that TikTok U.S. may not be able to deliver the same level of performance as the existing TikTok because it is heavily reliant on ByteDance\u2019s engineers in China to update and maintain the code base to maximize user engagement, sources added.",

            "title": "Heatwave: Why is north and central India facing a severe heatwave? | Explained",
            "publish_date": "2024-05-31",
            "text": "The story so far: At least five people in Bihar\u2019s Aurangabad city reportedly died on Thursday due to a sunstroke, news agency Reuters reported. Parts of north and central India continued to reel under a severe heatwave on Thursday, even as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted a gradual fall in temperature over the next five days. On Wednesday, an automatic weather station in Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 52.9 degrees Celsius, the highest temperature on record in the capital. The IMD, however, said that this could be due to \u201can error in sensor or local factors\u201d, since the recorded temperature was an outlier. The IMD is said that it is examining the data and sensors.\n\nTen more people were reported dead government hospital in Odisha\u2019s Rourkela region on Thursday due to the heat. A 40-year-old labourer in Delhi died due to a heatstroke (a condition in which the body temperature increases beyond 40 degrees C) on Thursday, The Indian Express reported. Despite these reports, it must be noted that heat-related deaths are widely underreported.\n\nWhat does IMD\u2019s latest report say?\n\nAs per the IMD report released Friday afternoon, maximum temperatures in northwest and central India are predicted to fall gradually by 2-3 degrees C in the next three days.\n\nMaximum temperatures on Thursday in most parts of Delhi, Haryana, and Chandigarh, as well as large parts of Rajasthan, and isolated pockets over eastern Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Odisha were recorded in the range of 45-48 degrees C.\n\nParts of western Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and coastal Andhra Pradesh, and isolated pockets over Gujarat, Telangana, and Rayalaseema recorded maximum temperatures in the range of 42-45 degrees C.\n\nHow do heatwaves arise?\n\nSome experts believe that post El Ni\u00f1o warming has contributed to higher-than-usual temperatures in north India this year.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a are atmospheric patterns that influence the warming and the cooling of sea surface temperatures in the Central and Equatorial Pacific. The two opposing patterns occur in an irregular cycle called the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, with a neutral period in between.\n\nIn March 2024, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) announced that even though the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o, which peaked as one of the strongest on record and has declined since, will continue to impact climate for the coming months. This exacerbates the heat captured by anthropogenically produced greenhouse gases, causing higher temperatures.\n\nThe IMD, in its May bulletin, said that weak El Ni\u00f1o conditions are currently observed over equatorial Pacific and are likely to weaken further and convert into ENSO neutral (the Australian Bureau of Meteorology had already announced on April 16 that the ENSO cycle is now in neutral).\n\nA study published in 2016 had predicted that if El Ni\u00f1o activity increases in the future, heatwaves in India were likely to intensify.\n\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o, surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific rise, and trade winds \u2014 east-west winds that blow near the Equator \u2014 weaken. Normally, easterly trade winds blow from the Americas towards Asia. Due to El Ni\u00f1o, they falter and change direction to turn into westerlies.\n\nENSO, however, does not cause extreme heat in isolation. Teleconnections, which are the relationships between global weather and wind patterns, impact each other. The Walker circulation, which involves the trade winds that blow from east to west along the Equator, are affected by ENSO due to teleconnections.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o is associated with a shift in Walker circulation, causing a large-scale redistribution of heat and moisture. Heat redistribution on the surface impacts airflows above the ocean. It is known that El Ni\u00f1o diminishes Indian monsoon since the weakened Walker circulation disrupts the flow of moist air from the Indian Ocean towards the Indian subcontinent, reducing the moisture available in the winds, hence creating drier conditions.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o also creates high-pressure areas over the Indian subcontinent, which suppress cloud formation and precipitation. The absence of clouds is also contributing to the current heatwave in north and central India.\n\nWhat\u2019s the cause of North India\u2019s heat?\n\nDelhi and most parts of north and central India that are currently under a heatwave spell, are far from the influence of oceans that can regulate temperatures and air moisture. Continental air, which is a large volume of dry air over a land mass, greatly affects the weather in Delhi because of its inland location. Tropical air masses that originate in the Thar Desert and other hotter, drier regions to the west and northwest of India bring increased heat to Delhi and surrounding areas, contributing to heatwave conditions.\n\nAnother important factor exacerbating heatwave conditions in India is loss of tree cover. \u201cThe vast expanses of open areas with very little or no trees increase the impact of direct sunlight,\u201d Indu K. Murthy, head of Climate, Environment and Sustainability at CSTEP, told The Hindu. According to the Global Forest Watch, India lost 2.33 million hectare of tree cover from 2001 to 2023, which is equivalent to a 6% decrease in tree cover since 2000, and 1.20 billion tonnes of CO\u2082e emissions.\n\nIn urban areas, the urban heat island (UHI) effect is also at play and contributes to hot conditions. In the UHI effect, urban areas are significantly warmer than their surroundings because building materials like concrete, asphalt, bricks, etc. have higher thermal inertia and absorb and retain more heat than natural landscapes, causing a localised increase in temperature. Densely packed buildings lack proper airflow that allows for cooling.\n\nA study published in Nature journal on May 15, 2024 found that urbanisation alone has led to a 60% enhancement in warming in Indian cities. The UHI effect contributes to global warming as it is associated with an increased demand for energy which leads to a higher production of greenhouse gases. The UHI effect can also impact climate factors other than heat, like rainfall, pollution, etc.\n\nA report by the Centre for Science and Environment, published in May 2024, found that cities are not cooling down at night at the same rate that they used to, not giving people a chance to recover from the daytime heat. \u201cHot nights are as dangerous as midday peak temperatures,\u201d the study noted. In Delhi, nights are slightly cooler by just 11.2 degrees C, which is 9% down from 2001-2010.\n\nThe CSE report also said that the UHI effect is stronger at night than daytime in Delhi.\n\nIs the Delhi Heat Action Plan enough?\n\nDelhi has a Heat Action Plan in place for 2024-2025, but at this stage, it is more like a set of guidelines.\n\n\u201cWhile the Heat Action Plan of Delhi is a fantastic first step, what is needed is building of capacity across the ecosystem, and the access to funds and facilities that could be utilised without too much bureaucratic hurdles. More importantly, a more disaggregated approach to looking at the problem, applying the demographic and socio-economic lens is a must, as many of the generic solutions may not really serve the under-privileged lower economic strata of people,\u201d Dr. Murthy from CSTEP said.\n\nThe Hindu reached out to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority to inquire about the steps it has undertaken to implement the Heat Action Plan, but did not receive a response.\n\nAditya Valiathan Pillai, a fellow at Sustainable Futures Collaborative, said if we don\u2019t start now, we won\u2019t be able to beat the heat in 10 years. \u201cDelhi has to play catch-up over the next couple of years, as implementing the ideas mentioned in the HAP takes time. My concern with this plan is it doesn\u2019t talk about financing. [The government] needs to figure out how it is going to finance this long list of solutions it has proposed,\u201d Mr. Pillai said.\n\nHe added that the plan needs to be grounded in some legal structure for it to \u201chave weight within the bureaucracy and the government\u201d.",

The yuan is at six-month lows on the dollar, the stock market shows signs of fatigue after a rebound from 5-year lows struck in February and benchmark 10-year government bond yields have hit record lows.\n\n\u201cInvestors\u2019 demand for offshore products have been rising quickly this year due to a weak yuan and sentiment,\u201d said Ivan Shi, head of research at Shanghai-based Z-Ben Advisors, adding alternative investments and foreign bonds are popular.\n\nIn April, Blackstone launched its first QDLP fund, channeling money to the firm\u2019s Private Equity Strategies fund.\n\nThe initial sales target of $40 million was reached in less than two weeks, according to two people familiar with the matter. Blackstone declined to comment. Market participants say Chinese authorities are largely encouraging the sector and more products are on the way.",

            "publish_date": "2024-05-31",
            "text": "In their opening statement at Donald Trump\u2019s criminal trial, the prosecutors seeking to win the first-ever criminal conviction of a sitting or former U.S. president made a bold prediction: they would have hard evidence to back up testimony from Michael Cohen, the star witness branded a liar by the defense.\n\nOver the next several weeks, jurors heard testimony from insiders at Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate company, his 2016 presidential campaign, and his White House that methodically backed up the two core elements of Manhattan District Alvin Bragg\u2019s case: that Mr. Trump was aware of a \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d conspiracy to buy the silence of people with negative information before the election, and that he was involved in a cover-up of Cohen\u2019s hush money payment to a porn star.\n\nThat testimony \u2014 coupled with evidence such as bank records, emails and a surreptitious recording of Trump speaking about a hush money payment \u2014 culminated in the 12-member jury finding Mr. Trump guilty of criminal charges.\n\nIts verdict: He illegally falsified business records to hide his reimbursement to Cohen for the $130,000 Cohen paid to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election about an alleged sexual encounter she had with Trump in 2006.\n\nTo be sure, jury deliberations are secret and the reasoning behind the decision to convict will not be clear unless any jurors decide to speak publicly. Trump is almost certain to appeal his conviction.\n\nCohen testified at the trial in New York state criminal court in Manhattan that the reimbursement payments were falsely labeled as legal retainer fees in Trump\u2019s family real estate company\u2019s books. Cohen said Trump directed him to pay off Daniels, and that he would not have done so without getting paid back.\n\n\u201cHe stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, some individuals, very smart people, and that: 'It's $130,000. You're like a billionaire. Just pay it,'\u201d Cohen said on May 13. \u201cAnd he expressed to me: 'Just do it.'\u201d\n\nThe verdict vindicated Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney who was criticized by both Trump's fellow Republicans and some of Bragg's fellow Democrats for bringing a case involving well-known allegations of sexual impropriety, even if the transaction that mattered was financial.\n\nEditorial |In the dock: On Donald Trump and his legal challenge\n\nBragg argued the case was truly about an effort to corrupt the 2016 election - not sex.\n\n\"It was the subversion of democracy,\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said in his May 28 closing statement. The \"catch-and-kill\" conspiracy, he said, was meant \"to manipulate and defraud the voters, to pull the wool over their eyes in a coordinated fashion.\"\n\nThe case is widely viewed as less consequential than the other three criminal cases Mr. Trump faces on charges over efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democratic President Joe Biden and his retention of sensitive government documents after leaving the White House in 2021.\n\nMr. Trump has pleaded not guilty in the other three cases, which are unlikely to reach juries before his Nov. 5 election rematch with Mr. Biden.\n\n\u2018Out of character\u2019\n\nOne challenge for Bragg's case was Cohen's credibility. Cohen went to prison after pleading guilty in 2018 to violating campaign finance law with the payment to Daniels and lying to Congress in 2017 about a Trump Organization real estate project in Russia. Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche hounded Cohen on cross-examination about his lies to journalists and an instance in which he stole from Trump's company.\n\nSo prosecutors needed plenty of evidence backing up Cohen\u2019s testimony that Trump was aware of Cohen\u2019s payment to Daniels, which they argued was part of a broader conspiracy to buy the silence of people with potentially negative information about Trump in violation of campaign finance laws.\n\nJurors did not have to rely solely on Cohen\u2019s testimony to accept that Trump intended to conceal that alleged conspiracy by labeling his 2017 payments to Cohen as legal retainer fees.\n\nDavid Pecker, the then-publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid, testified that he agreed at an August 2015 meeting with Trump and Cohen to be the campaign\u2019s \u201ceyes and ears\u201d for women coming forward with unflattering stories about Trump.\n\nJurors heard a tape Cohen surreptitiously recorded of Mr. Trump on Sept. 6, 2016, discussing a hush money payment Pecker\u2019s company made to Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who says she had a year-long affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007. Trump denied having ever had a sexual relationship with her or with Daniels.\n\nJurors saw phone records showing Cohen had several calls with Trump and his bodyguard Keith Schiller - whom Cohen said would hand his phone to Trump - around the time of frantic negotiations with Daniels\u2019 lawyer over the payment in October 2016.\n\nIn some of his most damning testimony, Cohen said he, Mr. Trump and then-Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg discussed the repayment plan in a January 2017 meeting shortly before Trump\u2019s inauguration as president.\n\nWeisselberg, who is serving a five-month jail sentence after pleading guilty to perjury in a separate case, did not testify for either side at the trial. But jurors saw Weisselberg\u2019s handwritten notes - jotted down on a copy of the wire transfer receipt for Cohen\u2019s payment to Daniels\u2019 lawyer - with instructions as to how Trump Organization controller Jeff McConney should pay Cohen. McConney testified that he understood the payments to be a reimbursement for Cohen, not legal fees.\n\nHope Hicks, a former communications aide of Trump\u2019s, recalled Trump telling her that Cohen paid Daniels \u201cout of the kindness of his own heart\u201d - consistent with the defense\u2019s efforts to distance Trump himself from the hush money deals.\n\nBut Hicks expressed skepticism of that claim.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d Hicks testified on May 3, \u201cwould be out of character for Michael.\u201d",

But Mr. Machavariani had nothing but praise for Mr. Ivanishvili, Georgia\u2019s richest man.\n\n\u201cGeorgia often overlooks his kindness and focuses on the negatives,\u201d he said.\n\nSince founding Georgian Dream 12 years ago, Mr. Ivanishvili has been a divisive figure in Tbilisi, ruling his party from behind the scenes after briefly serving as Prime Minister from 2012 to 2013.\n\nHe makes public appearances sparingly, giving an impassioned defence of the controversial \u201cforeign influence\u201d law in a rare speech laden with anti-Western rhetoric in April.\n\nThe Opposition has accused him of being sympathetic towards Russia, the country where he made his fortune in the 1990s, but his party has rejected this.\n\n\u2018May God bless him\u2019\n\nIn the nearby town of Sachkhere, police cars patrolled outside Georgian Dream\u2019s local headquarters, and many residents were hesitant to talk.\n\n\u201cI do not watch or observe political developments,\u201d Ketevan Toroshelidze, a 46-year-old ice cream vendor at the local market said.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I am interested in is supporting Georgian Dream and maintaining peace in Georgia,\u201d she added.\n\nGeorgian Dream has often accused the Opposition of antagonising ex-Soviet neighbour Moscow, warning the Kremlin could open a \u201csecond front\u201d in Georgia in addition to Ukraine. The Opposition has accused Mr. Ivanishvili of scare-mongering an already deeply polarised population.\n\nThe question of Kremlin interference in politics is particularly sensitive in Georgia, where Russian troops still occupy a fifth of the country following a 2008 war, and the invasion of Ukraine has only added to security concerns.\n\nThe billionaire returned to frontline politics last year, raising fears among the Opposition he might steer Tbilisi away from its national dream of joining the European Union and NATO, an idea supported by more than 80% of the population.\n\nBut Ms. Toroshelidze had no complaints about the ruling party. \u201cPeople are employed, and we have a peaceful life with our families,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the plush hospital building in the town\u2019s centre, officials were not available to talk. The mayoral office in Chorvila agreed to give an interview, but later declined.",

Over the previous decade, UAE accepted more than 2,500 tonnes of smuggled gold with a total value of over $115 billion, it said.\n\nAsked to comment on the findings, a UAE official said the country had taken significant steps to address concerns about gold smuggling and implemented new regulations on gold and other precious metals.\n\nThe scale of the flow underscores how small scale, or artisanal, mining has mushroomed into an industry involving millions of people producing volumes of gold on a par with or even bigger than industrial mining.\n\nIn 2019, a Reuters investigation found that billions of dollars\u2019 worth of gold was being smuggled out of Africa every year through the UAE, which served a gateway to markets in Europe, the U.S. and beyond.\n\nAside from the loss in tax revenues, experts and governments have warned that smuggling on this scale indicates a vast parallel illicit economy vulnerable to potential money laundering, terrorist finance and sanctions evasion.\n\nMarc Ummel, commodities lead at Swissaid and one of the authors of the report, said the UAE contributes to gold laundering because large quantities of smuggled gold acquire a legal existence by transiting through the UAE.\n\nDiscrepancies\n\nFor its analysis, Swissaid compared total gold exports from all African countries with gold imports into non-African countries. The organisation filled gaps in UN Comtrade data with individual country statistics and identified errors by comparing the data with figures reported by trade associations and speaking with governments and refineries.\n\nThese discrepancies between declared exports and declared imports do not exist for Switzerland and India, the other two major gold importing countries for African gold.\n\nThe Swissaid report found that there were 12 countries in Africa involved in smuggling 20 tonnes or more per year.\n\nIn response to accusations that it was not doing enough to enforce regulations on the sector, a UAE Ministry of Economy spokesperson said the UAE cannot be held accountable for other government\u2019s export records. \u201cOnly our own, where we have sophisticated technologies and systems to track and verify the data.\u201d\n\nWith the gold price having doubled since 2009, the number of people turning to artisanal mining has surged. Swissaid estimates that artisanal and small-scale gold mining in African countries produced between 443 and 596 tonnes of gold in 2022. Of this, more than 70% is not declared. By comparison, industrial miners have produced around 500 tonnes of gold a year.\n\nThe report found that the majority of African gold imported into the UAE each year comes from informal artisanal and small-scale mining. These methods provide a livelihood to millions of Africans but often come at a high cost to local communities and the environment.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain hypocrisy with some of the Swiss refineries,\u201d said Mr. Ummel. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to source African artisanal gold directly but at the same time import very high quantities of gold from the UAE, which is the main hub for African artisanal gold.\u201d",

            "text": "Alphabet's Google and augmented reality startup Magic Leap are forming a strategic technology partnership and working on building immersive experiences that blend the physical and digital worlds.\n\nMagic Leap said in a blog post on Thursday that the two companies have agreed to a partnership. A Google spokesperson confirmed the agreement.\n\nWhile short on details, the announcement adds to signals that Google may be plotting a return to the market for augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies that it so far has largely yielded to rivals Meta and Apple. The partnership would combine Florida-based Magic Leap's expertise in optics and device manufacturing with Google's technology platforms, Magic Leap said.\n\n\"We've shipped a couple of different versions of augmented reality devices so far, so we're out there delivering things, and Google has a long history of platforms thinking,\" Magic Leap's Chief Technology Officer Julie Larson-Green told Reuters in an interview ahead of the announcement.\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\n\"So we're thinking, putting our expertise and their expertise together, there's lots of things we could end up doing,\" she said.\n\nGoogle is an investor in Magic Leap, which is majority owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The startup was an early darling in the AR headset space, but struggled to find a consumer niche and more recently started exploring arrangements to license its technology or produce components for others. Magic Leap and Google both declined to say whether the partnership was expected to yield a consumer AR device. Google also has been collaborating with Samsung Electronics since early last year to develop mixed reality technologies, which the Google spokesman said was unchanged by the deal with Magic Leap. Larson-Green said she was especially eager to work with some of the \"cool AI tie-ins\" with augmented reality that Google announced at its annual developer conference earlier this month.\n\nIn a video at that event, Google showed off an AI agent called Project Astra by having someone don a glasses prototype and ask the agent questions about what that person was seeing. The agent gave answers in both audio form and as digital text overlaid on the lenses.\n\nThat functionality is similar to what Meta is planning for its Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, which added an AI assistant last year and in April received a software update enabling the agent to identify objects seen by the wearer in audio form.\n\nFIRST MOVER\n\nIf Google were to jump back into making AR glasses, it would be yet another dramatic twist in the company's on-again, off-again relationship with the technology.\n\nGoogle was a first mover in what it pitched as an AR revolution more than a decade ago, when it introduced its Google Glass smart glasses. Its enthusiasm then was so great that it unveiled the device in an elaborate 2012 demo involving skydivers using the glasses to live stream a jump on to a San Francisco building.\n\nHowever, consumers recoiled at the product's clunky design and privacy concerns, to the point that those who wore it were sometimes called \"glassholes.\" Google retreated from the consumer market in 2015 and later abandoned the enterprise market as well.\n\nTwo years ago, though, the company came back with a preview of a new set of glasses that it said would display real-time translations of conversations in English, Mandarin, Spanish and American Sign Language.\n\nThe future of that project was thrown into doubt in January, when Google laid off hundreds of employees in its hardware units, including the majority of its AR team.",

The late queen was ruler of Indore for nearly three decades in the 18th century, after being widowed early in life, and was considered not only progressive but also contributed to greatly to the revival of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple and the Maheshwari weaving style.\n\n\u201cEven today, her character is ideal for us. Unfortunately, she became a widow early in life, but despite being a single woman, she not only managed her large kingdom, but also made it bigger, and not only made the kingdom bigger, but also ran it as a good governance. She is the ideal of what kind of ruler should be like,\u201d Mr Bhagwat said in a video message.\n\nPraising her contributions, Mr Bhagwat noted that she had built industries so that the people could get employment and built them so strong that the textile industry of Maheshwar was still running and providing employment to many people. \u201cThe word Punyashlok is behind her name. Punyashlok is the ruler who frees the people from all kinds of deprivations. She built industries so that the people could get employment and built them so strong that the textile industry of Maheshwar is still running and employs many people. She also cared for all the sections,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShe made the tax system of her kingdom well-organized. She cared for the farmers. Her kingdom was good in every way. Efforts to emulate her, to remember her will go on everywhere throughout the year, it is a matter of great joy,\u201d he added.\n\nEvents to mark the beginning of the 300th anniversary of the late queen\u2019s birth have been planned and will receive support from the RSS, sources said.",

            "text": "NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg on May 31 dismissed warnings by Russian President Vladimir Putin that allowing Kyiv to use Western weapons for strikes inside Russian territory might lead to an escalation.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of a NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Prague, Mr. Stoltenberg said the alliance had heard such warnings many times before.\n\n\"This is nothing new. It has (...) been the case for a long time that every time NATO allies are providing support to Ukraine, President Putin is trying to threaten us to not do that,\" he told reporters. \"And an escalation \u2014 well, Russia has escalated by invading another country.\"\n\nMr. Putin on Tuesday warned NATO members against allowing Ukraine to fire their weapons into Russia and raised a new risk of nuclear war after several allies lifted restrictions imposed on the use of weapons donated to Kyiv.\n\nPolicy shift\n\nIn a marked policy shift, U.S. President Joe Biden has also authorised Kyiv the limited use of U.S.-supplied weapons inside Russia, four officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Thursday.\n\nMr. Biden's decision applies only to targets inside Russia near the border with the Kharkiv region, where an offensive launched by Moscow on May 10 has overrun some villages, they explained. The U.S. is by far the largest arms donor to Kyiv.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is 30 km from the border with Russia.\n\nIn Berlin on May 31, a German government spokesman said Ukraine could use weapons supplied by Berlin to defend itself against attacks launched from just inside Russia against the Kharkiv border region, in accordance with international law.\n\n\u2018Ukraine has the right to self-defence\u2019\n\nMr. Stoltenberg said Ukraine had the right to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia, especially since the borderline and the frontline near Kharkiv were more or less the same, and it was not reasonable to assume Kyiv should not hit back.\n\n\"Of course, it makes it very hard for Ukraine to defend themselves if they are not allowed to use advanced weapons to repel those attacks,\" he said. \"Ukraine has the right to self-defence, we have the right to help Ukraine uphold the right for self-defence, and that does not make NATO allies a party to the conflict,\" Stoltenberg added.\n\n\"That was the case back in February 2022, that was the case last year, that remains the case.\"",

            "text": "Starting conversations about menstruation helps children in more than one way. Delivering a message that leaves no room for doubt, provides them with appropriate information, and reassures them that menstruation is a natural, physiological process helps girls stay prepared but also does away with the fear and misconceptions associated with menstruation.\n\nMenstruation has traditionally been talked about in hushed tones. This Menstrual Hygiene Day (May 28), #PeriodFriendlyWorld kicked off conversations on social media on menstrual hygiene, doing away with taboos and stigma surrounding menstruation and access to menstrual products.\n\nNormalising conversations\n\nNormalising conversations around menstruation and educating children should be the way ahead. Jaishree Gajaraj, senior consultant, Obstetrician, and Gynaecologist, MANGAI Women\u2019s Health Exclusive, said that many schools are already holding sessions for children. \u201cWe are seeing girls coming of age very early, and due to awareness, we do not see them surprised anymore. Mothers should sit with their children and explain the whole process. They should tell them that it is not necessary that they get periods every month, and it is not necessary that it should stop in three days and could even be longer,\u201d she said.\n\nSumana Manohar, senior consultant, Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, Apollo Women\u2019s Hospital, pointed out that educating children both at home and school will help reinforce menstruation as a physiological phenomenon.\n\nAlso Read | World Menstrual Hygiene Day 2023: What are India\u2019s challenges?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s look at the age of menarche. The average age is between 10 and 15 years. Both puberty occurring before the age of eight, which is called precocious puberty, and delayed puberty beyond the age of 16 should be evaluated. Mostly, puberty occurs between 10 and 12 years. So, ideally, schools should start educating girls about menstrual hygiene and how it is a normal physiological process when they are in class V. The school environment should be conducive, enabling them to change sanitary pads, and clean toilets are important,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India maintains that the average age of menarche is 13.5, this is not the case in urban areas, where the average age of puberty is 10.5 to 11.5. Dr. Jaishree Gajaraj added: \u201cThe reason is that children are now more obese, as a result of which estrogen production increases and hormonal imbalances are triggered. Lifestyle and food habits are leading to obesity in children.\u201d\n\nThere are numerous doubts and concerns surrounding menstruation. But there is no need to worry about a number of things. As Dr. Sumana Manohar puts it: \u201cIrregular periods are quite common in the first three years of menarche. This is not a matter of great concern. Two to three cycles of periods in a year for the first three years, and three to four cycles of periods from the third year are normal as they do not ovulate properly.\u201d\n\nIrregular periods\n\nAnxious mothers taking their daughters to doctors for a number of related issues is quite common. \u201cWe see mothers bringing in their daughters for irregular periods. This is not something to worry about. Due to irregular periods, there may be heavy bleeding or pain that can be managed without medications. But, if there is profuse bleeding and unbearable pain, medical attention is required. Some of the main concerns that parents raise are lower abdominal pain and cramps. It is important for mothers to reassure their daughters and there is nothing to be scared about,\u201d she added.\n\nK. Kalaivani, director, Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Government Hospital for Women and Children, said children should be informed that pain or cramps are quite normal on the first and second days of periods, which will then subside. \u201cSome are worried about excessive bleeding. It varies from person to person. They need not worry because it subsides after the third day,\u201d she said.\n\nStressing hygiene, she said, \u201cSome do not bathe for three days, but that shouldn\u2019t be the case. Personal hygiene is important. Times have changed, and there is better access to sanitary pads with the State government supplying them free to schools. \u201cVending machines have also come up in a number of places,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Jaishree says young children should use regular sanitary pads, while those over 20 years \u2014 married or unmarried \u2014 can use menstrual cups. \u201cWe should tell children that this is a very normal physiological event. It should be taught in a way that in the years to come, children will look at it that way. To enable better orientation towards menstruation, we should educate both girls and boys simultaneously. Parents and older siblings should be encouraged when questions are asked and there should be no secrecy,\u201d she added.",

The Tories trailed with around 36,000 as of May 29, when the smaller opposition Liberal Democrats joined the fray.\n\nClashing approaches\n\nA smattering of videos on the Conservative page include Mr. Sunak talking to the camera about his pledge to bring back national service if they retain power.\n\nThe move \u2014 which would require 18-year-olds to join the military for 12 months or spend a weekend every month for a year volunteering in their community \u2014 has become a hot topic on TikTok and is opposed by many of its young users.\n\nLabour's campaign has taken a slightly different approach, which experts say highlights the contrasting strategies and stakes for Mr. Sunak and Keir Starmer, who is tipped to be the country's next leader after the election.\n\nOne Labour TikTok post uses a clip from the movie \"Shrek\" showing the diminutive villain Lord Farquaad saying \"Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make\".\n\nThe caption on the video reads, \"Rishi Sunak announcing national service\", with the video garnering more than 2.5 million views in just a few days.\n\nAnother reaction to the announcement features the late Cilla Black singing the theme tune to her long-running light-entertainment programme \"Surprise, Surprise\".\n\nOther posts use clips from Mr. Sunak's shaky start to his national campaign, including his announcement of the election during a torrential downpour.\n\nLabour's meme-heavy approach is markedly different from its strategy on other social media platforms, says Andrew Chadwick, professor of political communication at Loughborough University.\n\n\"The cutting edge of the wacky videos- the ones where risk-taking is involved- is happening on TikTok right now. And I think that is something new,\" he said.\n\nIn contrast, he finds the Tory TikTok campaign \"fairly dull\".\n\nHowever, Mr. Gatt says Mr. Sunak's \"traditional\" approach is \"very well-thought-through\".\n\n\"He's trying to present himself, as I understand it, as a man with a plan at a very serious time for the world,\" said Mr. Gatt, who has previously managed digital communication for various government departments.\n\n\"He's going to try and show a way where he's authentic. Authenticity and credibility are key to successful TikToks.\"\n\nNew audience\n\nWhile the last few general election campaigns have focused on social media, mainly Facebook and Twitter, this is the first election in which TikTok will be in the spotlight.\n\nOnly 1% of U.K. adults used TikTok for news in 2020, according to the country's media regulator Ofcom.\n\nThe figure rose to 10% by last year, making TikTok the fastest-growing source of news in the U.K.\n\nThe audience on TikTok has expanded beyond young people as well. The \"perception of a TikTok user being more of a liberal, left-leaning, younger person may not be true anymore,\" says Mr. Gatt.\n\nCurrently ahead of both the Tories and Labour, the party with the highest TikTok following is actually Reform U.K., an anti-immigration right-wing populist party claiming to be the \"new Conservatives\".\n\nAdding a layer of novelty, on TikTok, unlike Facebook and Twitter, political advertising is banned. This also means that parties cannot buy ads to target specific audiences.\n\nInstead, they are \"dependent upon TikTok's algorithm and ordinary users\", Mr. Chadwick says, which adds pressure to adapt to the new environment.\n\nFor Mr. Chadwick, \"Labour has got a better understanding of this at this point in time\" because they are producing the kind of content that \"would not appear in an ad\".\n\nThe lack of paid political advertising on the platform also opens up room for unpredictability regarding how the TikTok campaigns could affect the election.\n\n\"They can't control the environment in the way that they've learned to control online advertising during campaigns over recent election cycles,\" said Mr. Chadwick.",

            "text": "On the edge of the Afghan border with Uzbekistan, where the railway abruptly stops, throngs of young men transfer sacks of wheat or flour from freight trains to trucks.\n\nEvery day, 3,500 tons of flour and 1,500 tonnes of wheat are unloaded by hand at the border town of Hairatan in northern Afghanistan to trucks that brave mountain passes and war-damaged roads to ferry goods around the country.\n\nRenovations are underway to connect the rundown track with Mazar-i-Sharif, the north's largest city, and according to the Taliban authorities, it will come into operation from June.\n\nJust 75 kilometres (47 miles) long, it is an important part of the Taliban government's ambitions to revive several dormant railway projects.\n\nThe long-envisioned Trans-Afghan Railway aims to eventually connect Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan with 700 kilometres of track, backed by the three countries that have established a working group.\n\n\"People have been talking about the Trans-Afghan Railway for more than 100 years,\" said Andrew Grantham, news editor of the U.K.-based Railway Gazette International, a media outlet dedicated to covering developments in the rail sector.\n\nIn addition to foodstuffs and logs from Russia, fuel and other materials arrive in Hairatan from Central Asian republics and China, with the Taliban government aspiring to see those goods traverse Afghanistan by rail under their rule.\n\n\"Trans-Afghan will become the economic corridor between Central Asia and South Asia,\" said Mohammad Shafiq Mahmood, head of the Balkh railway authority in Mazar-i-Sharif.\n\nIt is one of two railway projects the Taliban authorities are pursuing in a bid to better connect Afghanistan \u2014 a country wracked by decades of war and poverty that has never built its own railways.\n\nA second line of more than 200 kilometres at the other end of the country is intended to connect the city of Herat with its western neighbour Iran, providing Afghanistan with an outlet to the sea, Turkey and Europe.\n\nThis is a project envisaged for some 15 years, long before the Taliban's return to power in 2021.\n\nRailway transport is the fastest and cheapest means of transporting goods, with passenger trains not on the table at this stage in Afghanistan.\n\nBillions of dollars\n\nBuilding a line all the way through to Pakistan will take time, however, said Abdulsami Durrani, the national railway spokesperson in Kabul.\n\n\"According to our current estimates, once the actual work on this project begins, the construction phase will take three to five years,\" he told AFP.\n\nHe added preliminary figures suggest a price tag of $4-5 billion, though he remained vague about sources of funding.\n\n\"We are in discussions with various countries and financial institutions,\" he said.\n\nForeign funds have withered since the Taliban's return to power, their government not formally recognised by any country.\n\n\"Building a railway on that scale in five years, it's not going to happen,\" said Mr. Grantham.\n\n\"It's just too ambitious,\" he told AFP, emphasising that Kabul will need foreign financial and technical aid.\n\nWestern companies will likely not be interested due to \"security and safety issues and the political environment\", he added.\n\nBut Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, as well as Russia, are already working with Afghanistan.\n\nOther countries, such as Iran, could also provide support.\n\nAccess to the sea\n\n\"The projects do seem to be happening,\" said Mr. Grantham, noting that the line connecting Herat to Iran \"can be up and running reasonably quickly\".\n\n\"Assuming Iran is supportive, that should be a viable project,\" he said.\n\nOn May 26, work began on the final phase of this line.\n\nThe 47-kilometre section will be built in two years for $53 million, with Russian and Turkish partners, said Mr. Durrani.\n\nThis railway will give landlocked Afghanistan access to the sea and connect it with international trade routes, and will \"significantly impact Afghanistan's economy\", he added.\n\n\"The more kilometres of railways are developed in the country, the more our trade with other countries will increase.\"\n\nIn addition to funding, there remain thorny technical issues to resolve, notably the track gauge.\n\nIran uses European gauge standards, but the railways coming from the former Soviet republics have a different gauge, and Pakistan's have a third.\n\n\"You can have hours of fun,\" working out which of the three gauges Afghanistan should use, said Mr. Grantham.",

Later the problem was found to be a zero-day flaw that was being exploited by hackers.\n\nAt the time the company said it had witnessed multiple attempts that when analysed were found to have the same pattern.\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\n\u201cThe vulnerability potentially allows an attacker to read certain information on Internet-connected Gateways with remote access VPN or mobile access enabled\u201d, the company said in a blog post.\n\nThe company created an FAQ page with additional information about the vulnerability and created a remote access validation script that can be used to review results and take appropriate actions.\n\nCheck Point is the second company to have issued an alert warning customers of attacks on VPN devices. Earlier, Cisco also warned about widespread credential brute-forcing attacks targeting VPN and SSH services on Cisco, Check Point, Sonic Wall, Fortinet, and Ubiquiti devices.\n\nThe campaign reportedly started around 18 March with attacks originating from TOR exit nodes that are used to anonymize user access to a network to provide private web browsing increasing network security. The attack campaign was found using various anonymization tools and proxies to evade blocks, a report from Bleeping Computer said.",

The P-8 aircraft is the premier U.S. submarine hunter-tracker that is increasingly deployed in the region against China\u2019s submarine patrols.\n\nFPDA first took form in 1971 to safeguard the external defence of Singapore and Malaysia, amid the withdrawal of British forces from Singapore.\n\nF-35 fighter jets from Australia and elements of the U.K.\u2019s Carrier Strike Group are some of the next-generation capabilities that will be incorporated in future joint military drills under FPDA.\n\nThese ideas were discussed as defence representatives of the FPDA countries met for the 12th FPDA Defence Ministers\u2019 Meeting (FDMM) in Singapore, where they agreed to include more high-end warfighting capabilities in exercises under the grouping.\n\nThe FDMM, which is the highest decision-making platform of the FPDA, is held every three years, with Singapore and Malaysia taking turns to host. This time round, the meeting is held on the sidelines of the annual Shangri-La Dialogue, which kicked off on May 31 as well.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the meeting, Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles said his country will be contributing F-35 Joint Strike Fighters for the \u201cBersama Lima\u201d (Together Five) exercise to be held later this year.\n\nThe exercise is one of the regular exercises aimed at building the ability of FPDA countries to operate well together, as well as improving the proficiency of their air, maritime and land forces.\n\nPointing out that this will make it the first time a fifth-generation aircraft is to participate in Bersama Lima, Marles said: \u201cIt\u2019s an example of what we are trying to do in terms of increasing the complexity of these exercises and the higher nature of them.\u201d\n\nIt remains relevant 53 years on, as the FPDA countries see it as playing an important role as a \u201cconstructive and peaceful defence arrangement\u201d in enhancing regional cooperation and strengthening military-to-military ties.\n\nSingapore\u2019s Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, who hosted this morning\u2019s meeting, said the FPDA will venture into building capabilities in \u201cnon-conventional\u201d fields as well.\n\nThis comes as parties discussed the need to build capabilities in areas such as counter-terrorism, maritime security, and humanitarian and disaster relief, Malaysian Defence Minister Mohamed Khaled Nordin added.\n\nThe non-conventional needs are why future exercises intend to feature drones and unmanned aircraft, Mr. Ng said.",

It finally settled at 83.49 (provisional), registering a loss of 20 paise from its previous closing level.

After the conclusion of the medical exam, Mr.; Prajwal was taken to the City civil court where he was produced before the 42nd ACMM court judge.\n\nThe SIT is likely to request the court to hand over Mr. Prajwal to their custody. The Hassan MP was arrested by the SIT on May 30 night at Bengaluru Airport.\n\nH.D. Revanna abduction case\n\nThe SIT has also filed an application in the High Court questioning H.D. Revanna\u2019s bail in the kidnapping case of a woman from KR Nagar, Mysore. According to SIT, Mr. Revanna should continue to remain in custody until this investigation is over and therefore, the SIT has moved the High Court to cancel the bail.\n\nThe application will be heard in the High Court bench headed by Justice Krishna S Dixit. The hearing of the petition filed by Mr. Revanna to cancel this case will also be held on May 31 in the High Court.\n\nMr. Revanna was arrested earlier in connection with a kidnapping case on April 29. He was granted conditional bail by a special court for people\u2019s representatives.\n\nMr.. Prajwal who was brought to the CID office in Bengaluru after he landed at Kempegowda International Airport is likely to face a probe by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) over allegations of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation following a complaint by a woman who worked in his household.\n\nSuspended JD(S) MP Prajwal Revanna, facing allegations of sexually abusing several women, was interrogated after the Special Investigation Team (SIT) arrested him as soon as he landed at the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru in the wee hours of May 31.\n\nThe 33 year-old MP, who arrived from Munich, was taken to the CID office for interrogation, sources in the SIT said.\n\nThe SIT will produce him before the Special Court and is likely to seek police custody to further interrogate him.\n\nMr. Prajwal left the SIT office to the Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital in Bengaluru for various medical tests including blood pressure, blood sugar level and cardiac health. Security was tightened at the hospital in view of his arrival.\n\nThe SIT is also contemplating a potency test on Prajwal.\n\nThe Special Court for Public Representatives will hear the bail plea of Mr. Prajwal and his mother Bhavani Revanna on May 31.\n\nIn the first reaction after the arrest, Karnataka Home MInister G. Parameshwar said that as Mr. Prajwal had promised, he has appeared and SIT has taken custody of him.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe SIT wanted to send a message that women have been wronged in this episode, and that empowered woman police officers to bring him to the SIT office.\u201d\n\nThe Home Minister said, \u201cThere have been statements from Mr. Prajwal that there is a conspiracy against him. I request that this should not be politicised further.\u201d\n\nHe further added that \u201cSIT is capable of investigating the case in its entirety and let the investigators do the job. I am refraining from making any political statement and request everyone to not make a political event out of this.\u201d\n\nMr. Prajwal faces three sexual abuse cases, while his mother has sought anticipatory bail in an alleged kidnapping case.\n\nThough Ms. Bhavani is not an accused in the case, SIT has reportedly desired to investigate her role.\n\nIn the same case, Ms. Bhavani's husband and Holenarasipura MLA H D Revanna, who is former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda's son, was arrested and later released on bail. He is also an accused of sexually harassing the cook of his house, who was also sexually abused by his son Prajwal.\n\nThe 33-year-old Mr. Prajwal, grandson of Deve Gowda and the BJP-JD(S) alliance candidate from Hassan Lok Sabha segment, is facing charges of sexually abusing many women. He has been so far booked in three cases of sexual assault.\n\nHe had left for Germany on April 27, a day after Hassan went to polls. A 'Blue Corner Notice' seeking information on his whereabouts was issued by the Interpol earlier, following a request by the SIT via the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).\n\nThe MP, terming the cases against him as false and alleging political conspiracy, had said in a video statement issued earlier this week that he had gone into depression.\n\nHe had also filed an anticipatory bail plea at the Principal City and Sessions Court for Elected Representatives on May 29, which issued a notice to the SIT to file objections, before posting the hearing for Friday.\n\nThe scandal has raised a political storm with the ruling Congress and BJP-JD(S) engaged in a slugfest.\n\nWhile the Congress government has formed a SIT to probe the cases, the BJP and JD(S) \u2014 NDA partners \u2014 have demanded that it be handed over to the CBI, and action be taken against those behind the wide circulation of explicit videos.\n\nThe cases of sexual abuse came to light after a number of pen drives allegedly containing explicit videos involving Prajwal were reportedly circulated in Hassan, ahead of Lok Sabha polls there on April 26.\n\nMr. Deve Gowda had recently issued a 'stern warning' to Prajwal, asking him to return to the country and face probe into the sexual abuse allegations, while asserting there will be no interference from him or other family members into the enquiry.\n\nThe JD(S) supremo had reiterated that his grandson should be given the harshest punishment under the law \"if found guilty\".\n\nMr. Prajwal's uncle and former Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy too had repeatedly appealed to his nephew to return to the country from abroad and face the probe.\n\nJD(S) has suspended Prajwal Revanna from the party following the allegations.",

            "text": "India's election was in full swing when hundreds of social media users shared a video that appeared to show Home Minister Amit Shah saying the ruling party wanted to scrap a quota system aimed at undoing centuries of caste discrimination.\n\nThe controversial comments caused a brief furore before fact-checkers stepped in and declared the video a fake that had been made using old footage that was doctored with the help of basic editing tools - a so-called cheapfake.\n\nIn the run-up to the ongoing election, the results of which are due on June 4, politicians and digital rights groups voiced concern that voters could be swayed by misinformation contained in AI-driven \"deepfake\" videos.\n\nBut fact-checkers say most the falsified pictures and videos posted online during the six-week election have not been made using artificial intelligence (AI), instead using relatively cheap and simple techniques such as footage editing or mislabelling to present content in a misleading context.\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\n\"Maybe 1% of the content we have seen is AI-generated,\" said Kiran Garimella, an assistant professor at Rutgers University who researches WhatsApp in India. \"From what we can tell, it's still a very small percentage of misinformation.\"\n\nWhether cheapfakes or deepfakes, the result can be equally convincing, fact-checkers say, putting the onus on social media companies to do more to root out all forms of misinformation being spread on their platforms.\n\n\"You can resurrect dead leaders using AI but people realise its propaganda... However, if you mislabel a video or clip it out of context, people are more likely to believe it,\" said Pratik Sinha from Alt News, an Indian nonprofit fact-checking website.\n\n\"Rather than getting into the binary of deepfakes and cheapfakes, there is a need for finding a way to tackle misinformation more effectively,\" Sinha told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nBoth Meta Platforms Inc, which owns Facebook and Instagram, and X, formerly Twitter, introduced new policies to crack down on different forms of misinformation in a big year for global elections, but fact-checking groups say the results have been disappointing.\n\nUPDATED GUIDELINES\n\nResponding to criticism from its oversight board, Meta updated its guidelines in April to add prominent labels to all forms of misinformation. Meta's earlier policy only applied to content altered or created using AI.\n\n\"We agree with the Oversight Board's argument that our existing approach is too narrow since it only covers videos that are created or altered by AI to make a person appear to say something they didn't say,\" Monika Bickert, the company's vice president of content policy, wrote in a blog post last month.\n\nUnder the new approach, which took effect before the Indian election started on April 19, fact-checkers working with Meta review and rate posts, including ads, articles, photos, videos, reels, audio on its social media network under six labels to provide more information to users.\n\nThey can use the labels False, Partly False, Altered, Missing Context, Satire and True.\n\nSinha questioned the policy's effectiveness in tackling false and misleading digitally manipulated posts over the election period.\n\n\"I'm not sure how effective Meta's labelling has been,\" he said, calling for the company to release data on its fact-checking programmes.\n\nAn analysis by the Thomson Reuters Foundation found many fact-checked videos on Facebook had not been labelled correctly, or carried no warning label at all.\n\nIn one video doctored through editing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears to ask supporters to vote for a rival party. Rather than being labelled Altered, it is labelled Partly False - meaning it contains \"some factual inaccuracies\".\n\nX's introduction in April of a new feature for Indian users to combat misinformation has also fallen short, said Karen Rebelo, deputy editor at fact-checking website Boom Live.\n\nAccording to X, its Community Notes feature is designed to combat misinformation by inviting users from diverse backgrounds to contribute as note authors to set the record straight.\n\nBut Rebelo said different note authors often contradict each other, creating further confusion as no clear consensus arises on the veracity of the post in question.\n\n\"A lot of misinformation has notes on it but it's not surfacing because other contributors don't agree with it. X needs to find a way to work this out because otherwise it defeats the purpose of community notes,\" she said.\n\nThe Thomson Reuters Foundation found a cheapfake video of Mallikarjun Kharge, president of the opposition Congress, could be found on X and had no notes on it despite being debunked by fact-checking websites.\n\nIn the mislabelled footage, viewed 43,000 times, Kharge appears to say his party would distribute Hindus' wealth to minority Muslims.\n\nBROADER THREAT\n\nEven when doctored videos have been labelled as fakes by social media platforms, they often still spread unabated on messaging apps such as WhatApp, Garimella said.\n\n\"Forty percent of the viral content being forwarded has already been fact-checked many times, but that hasn't stopped it from spreading because there is no moderation as such on the messaging app,\" Garimella said.\n\n\"That tells us that people perhaps aren't aware (it is fake),\" he said, warning that without tough controls by platforms that would likely continue.\n\nAhead of the election, Meta, which owns WhatsApp, launched a fact-checking helpline on the app with the Misinformation Combat Alliance (MCA) to combat AI-generated misinformation in India.\n\nMost content flagged to the helpline had been manipulated using simple methods, not AI-driven tools, said Pamposh Raina, head of the MCA's Deepfake Analysis Unit.\n\nBut the alarm about deepfakes may have distracted platforms from the broader threat of misinformation, Sinha said.\n\n\"We've hardly seen any deepfake videos that spread misinformation ... But (social media) put its money and resources into debunking deepfakes. It should have researched the market better,\" he said.",

To get it in your inbox, subscribe here.)\n\nChatGPT to be integrated into iPhone\n\nApple and OpenAI have finalised their agreement to integrate the AI chatbot ChatGPT into the iPhone, a report stated. While the details of the deal are under wraps, it could potentially be worth billions of dollars to the AI firm if a success. The report also said that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was left concerned by how the agreement would impact his company\u2019s partnership with OpenAI.\n\nApple, which is largely seen as lagging behind other Big Tech companies with regards to artificial intelligence, was in discussions with both OpenAI and Google but ended up picking the former in the end. The deal is a lucrative one for OpenAI which has been pushing its enterprise-focused side of operations to generate revenue. The report also claims that the firm could change its status to a for-profit organisation given the change it\u2019s gone through since Microsoft backed it from a non-profit research lab to a money-making venture now. The announcement is expected to be made public at Apple\u2019s developer summit, WWDC.\n\nTikTok making U.S. copy of app algorithm\n\nTikTok is reportedly working on the clone of its core recommendation algorithm that will work independently of its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, for 170 million users in the U.S. The move to split the source code is being done to appeal to U.S. lawmakers who signed a bill in April to either ban or force sale of the app in the U.S. Sources spoke to Reuters saying that this could lead to divesting of TikTok\u2019s U.S. assets but there are no current plans yet. TikTok denied any truth to the report.\n\nThe plans to split the code were set in place before the bill was signed in April. For the past few months, TikTok engineers have been working on splitting millions of lines of code and going through the algorithm that relates users to the videos they like. Sources shared that this will take a year to finish. The task is so mammoth that TikTok had even considered open-sourcing the algorithm instead to counter allegations from the U.S.\n\nOpenAI has stopped five attempts to misuse AI\n\nOpenAI said it has disrupted five influence operations that wanted to use its AI models for \u201cdeceptive activity\u201d online. Threat actors from Russia, China, Iran and Israel, used AI models to generate comments, long articles in multiple languages and make up fake names and bios on social media platforms over the past three months.\n\nThe networks were usually to mislead users around sensitive issues like Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the Gaza war, Indian elections and politics in the U.S. and Europe. OpenAI\u2019s report is similar to another one released by Meta which shared it had detected campaigns on its platforms using GenAI to generate fake content.\n\nThanks for reading Today\u2019s Cache.

            "text": "AI search company Perplexity has launched a new feature called Pages to generates AI-powered summaries of web pages based on user prompts. This can help users create instant reports, guides and articles in a format that is visually appealing.\n\nBoth free and paid users can avail the option to create a page under the library section by typing out what the report is about and what they want to know in the prompt box. Users can choose if the report is meant to cater to beginner-level audience or experts or the general audience.\n\nThe platform finds the information, then breaks it down into sections to write the page and then adds visuals. Users can then rewrite the content or reformat it or even edit them out. Additionally, they can add sections with text prompts and relevant media like images and videos.\n\nCEO Aravind Srinivas announced the feature on X saying, \u201cPerplexity\u2019s mission is to cater to the world\u2019s curiosity. We have taken inspiration from Wikipedia with citations. We\u2019re excited to take it further by launching Pages, best described as \u201cAI Wikipedia.\u201d The effort of analyzing sources and synthesizing a readable page is now possible with a simple \u201cone-click convert.\u201d\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\nGiven that all these pages are publishable and can be searched using Google, the feature seems apt for school assignments and aren\u2019t really geared towards in-depth research. Users can share this link of the page with other users who can have follow-up questions. A conversation thread can also be converted into a page with a click.\n\nPages will be rolled out to a limited number of users now, and gradually be made available to everyone, the company said. While users can just create pages on the web, they can be viewed on Perplexity mobile apps as well.\n\nThe Arc search browser has a version of this feature while Apple is rumoured to release a smart recap feature for web pages and articles.\n\nPerplexity AI is also in talks to raise a $250 million investment from Bessemer Venture Partners which would peg their valuation at $3 billion, a report by The Information stated.",

To save the country from dictatorship I am going to jail and I am proud of that,\u201d he said, and added, \u201cThey have tried to break many times, even tried to silence me but have not been successful. When I was jail too, I was tortured in many ways.\u201d\n\nHe further said \u201cMy medicines were stopped, I don\u2019t know why these people did that or what they wanted? My weight was 70kgs when I was arrested, today it is 64kgs. Even after being released, I have not gained weight. Doctors have indicated that this can also be a sign of some serious illness and many tests need to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will leave my house to surrender around 3 p.m. [on June 2]. It is possible they may torture me more, but I will not bow down. No matter where I am, inside or outside jail, I will not let stop the welfare of Delhi,\u201d he said. I will soon start providing \u20b91,000 to my mothers and sisters, he said referring to a scheme to give \u20b91,000 monthly honorarium.
