Users can now convert older photos captured on older devices. It comes in the wake of what has been a slow start for the company\u2019s long-awaited entry into the mixed reality space.\n\nThe efficacy of machine-generated images remains to be seen, but likely won\u2019t offer as accurate an image as those shots captured with depth cameras.

Whereas last year\u2019s event will be remembered as the event that finally introduced the world to the Vision Pro, the company is hoping to make WWDC 2024 even more memorable as it finally spells out its generative AI plans. Some things we can expect: a big Siri refresh, Mail with an injection of Apple\u2019s Ajax LLM to offer email reply suggestions and even a new look \u2014 and new features \u2014 for Apple Photos.\n\nYou\u2019ll find information on how to stream the event live over here.\n\nWWDC\u2019s opening salvo is different from other Apple keynotes, in that it\u2019s the kickoff to a weeklong online and in-person event, running from June 10 to 14. The company began opening things up more to the public during the pandemic, but it\u2019s important to remember the reason for the season: Much like Google I/O and Microsoft Build before it, the true purpose for the event is showcasing the latest updates for developers.\n\nAI everything\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nConcern that Apple has fallen behind on GenAI has been enough to prompt Cook to promise big things on shareholder calls. In fact, the CEO made the decision to comment on future plans. In May, he promised that the company would \u201cbreak new ground\u201d on generative AI, adding, \u201cWe believe it will unlock transformative opportunities for our users.\u201d\n\nWill Apple\u2019s bid to break new ground be, in fact, groundbreaking? I anticipate it will be big on promises for developers, highlighting how generative AI will affect future versions of the company\u2019s various operating systems \u2014 with a focus on iOS. Rumors around Apple\u2019s approach to the world of large language models have been swirling around for some time now.\n\nEarly reports suggested the company was meeting with Google about potential Gemini integration for iOS. That would be a huge win for Google, with the model playing a key role in two operating systems that account for a combined 96% of the global mobile operating system market. More recent reporting, however, has pointed to a partnership with OpenAI. Much like I/O before it, I would anticipate being sick and tired all the AI talk by the time the company is finished.\n\nFollowing the collapse of its electric car project, Apple reportedly shuffled a number of employees into its internal generative AI efforts. Given how fresh that news is, it\u2019s safe to say that the company is still trailing the competition there. With that in mind, I anticipate that a lot of the AI-related news will come off the back of its OpenAI deal.\n\niOS 18 with more AI\n\nImage Credits: Darrell Etherington\n\nAlong with that partnership, expect iOS 18 to be the centerpiece of the event. There\u2019s a lot riding on what is reportedly \u201cone of the biggest iOS updates \u2014 if not the biggest \u2014 in the company\u2019s history.\u201d It\u2019s going to be so big, in fact, that Sarah took time out of her busy schedule to collate the rumored updates. I don\u2019t want to repeat her work, so I\u2019m going to distill some of the rumors here. Go read her story for more.\n\nSiri will be getting a long-awaited refresh, courtesy of Apple\u2019s generative AI work. The update will make the smart assistant more capable with the ability to directly edit photos, delete emails and other daily tasks. The update is also said to be bringing an improved voice, notification summaries and an advanced version of Siri for Apple Watch.\n\nAI will also be infiltrating the Safari browser for more intelligent search, Notes for summarization and Voice Memos for transcriptions (something Google has touted for some time now).\n\nGenerative AI is even coming to emojis, allowing users to customize and create their own in Messages.\n\nApple is also said to be loosening up layout restrictions so users can place icons and widgets wherever they want on their home screen.\n\nEven Mail will get new AI-enabled features, like asking Siri to make emails sound more professional and suggested email replies generated by Ajax.\n\nApple announced that RCS (Rich Communication Services) is coming to Messages, to make Android users feel slightly less bad \u2014 still a green bubble, mind. Reports suggested it would arrive last fall, but that ship has obviously sailed. This coming fall, on the other hand, seems like a fine bet, especially with the whole DOJ thing looming.\n\nmacOS 15 debut\n\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\n\nEvery time Tim Cook says \u201cAI,\u201d an investor gets their wings. While iOS is undoubtedly going to be the big operating system focus, Apple\u2019s still got news in the works for desktop. We\u2019ll be getting the official name for macOS 15. What\u2019s the most AI California place name? Alameda? Alcatraz? RodAI Drive?\n\nA lot of the iOS updates should also make their way to macOS, including those in Siri, Notes and Safari. Apple\u2019s office apps are said to be getting a GenAI boost, as well. That includes assistance in Pages, Keynote and developer environment app Xcode.\n\nSystem Settings will be continuing Apple\u2019s longstanding project of turning macOS into iOS, with a design refresh. Apple should be overhauling some key accessibility features, as well. And don\u2019t forget the most exciting update of all, some big design changes to Calculator \u2014 the app most of us use but somehow never manage to think about.\n\nL-R: Space Black MacBook Pro, Space Gray Touchbar MacBook Pro Image Credits: Brian Heater\n\nWhile the last few years have showcased key hardware updates, owing to developments in Mac silicon and last year\u2019s headset preview, WWDC is not a hardware event. In fact, the latest buzzing from the rumor mill points to a keynote presentation that\u2019s very light on the hardware. Bloomberg is now even suggesting the event will be entirely devoid of new hardware.\n\nKeep in mind, Apple made an unusual choice of hosting a standalone virtual iPad event almost exactly a month prior to WWDC. The May 7 program debuted new versions of the iPad Pro and iPad Air. Much to the chagrin of many, AI didn\u2019t play a major role in the event. After all of the fanfare around models like GPT and the big fuss Google has been making around Gemini integration in Android, Apple needs to come out swinging next week.\n\nThat said, the new M4 chip did just debut on the iPad. MacBooks featuring the chip and its more powerful siblings can\u2019t be too far away. Nor can the upcoming iPhone A18 chip, which the company will almost certainly claim is \u201cthe most advanced smartphone chip for AI\u201d \u2014 or something equivalent.", "image_links": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WWDC-preview-featured-update.jpg?w=1200", "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/what-to-expect-from-wwdc-2024-ios-18-macos-15-and-so-much-ai/", "Summary": "- Apple's WWDC 2024 will focus on generative AI, with a major Siri refresh, AI-powered features in Mail, Photos, and other apps, and a big iOS 18 update.\n- The event will also see the debut of macOS 15, with AI-powered features for Safari, Notes, and office apps, as well as a design refresh for System Settings.\n- While hardware updates are expected to be minimal, Apple is likely to showcase its new M4 chip and the upcoming iPhone A18 chip, both of which will be touted for their AI capabilities.", "revised_title": "Apple WWDC 2024: AI Focus, iOS 18, and macOS 15 Updates"}, {"title": "Apple unveils iOS 18 with tons of AI-powered features", "content": "Apple shared the first details for the upcoming major release of iOS, its operating system specifically designed for the iPhone, at WWDC 2024.\n\nAs expected, this is a pivotal moment for the mobile platform as iOS 18 is going to focus on artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited that we\u2019ll introduce profound new intelligence capabilities that we hope will inspire developers, delight users, and make our platforms even smarter and more useful than ever,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said during its introduction of the event. Later in the presentation, Apple announced that it is integrating ChatGPT into Siri and other system-wide interactions.\n\nBut before talking about AI, Apple mentioned new customization features. Icons can now be laid out however you want on your home screen so that they don\u2019t hide your background photos.\n\n\u201ciOS 18 is a big release that delivers more ways to customize your iPhone, stay connected and relive special moments,\u201d said Apple SVP of software engineering Craig Federighi.\n\nIcons can be customized with a tint color. For instance, if you want all your icons to look yellow, you can tint all app icons to this color.\n\nControl Center is also getting an update. It isn\u2019t limited to just the buttons you see on the main control center page. You can swipe down to view media playback and home controls. You can also edit Control Center from Control Center directly by tapping on an edit button in a corner.\n\nThere is a new set of APIs for Control Center, meaning that third-party developers will be able to create Control Center and lock screen shortcuts. For instance, Apple showed that you can replace the camera button on the lock screen with a Snapchat button.\n\nApps can now be individually locked. This way, you need to identify with Face ID, Touch ID or your passcode to unlock this app. This app also doesn\u2019t appear in search results. Being able to hide apps will be important for AI features, too.\n\nMessages are getting a much welcome update to tapbacks. You can now react to messages with any emoji or sticker and they\u2019ll appear in color (pretty much like in every other messaging apps). You\u2019ll be able to send messages later and format text (underline, strikethrough, etc.). Apple is also adding RCS support to iOS 18. It was previously announced but the timeline was unclear. As a reminder, RCS is an update to the SMS protocol with more features, such as native group support.\n\nMail will also get new categories, a bit like Gmail categories so that promotions, newsletters and other transactional emails are hidden from your inbox. There\u2019s also a new digest view that pulls all the relevant emails you\u2019ve received, such as your flight information before heading to the airport.\n\nCalendar is receiving a small update with an optional integration with Reminders. You can decide to view reminders directly in your calendar.\n\nWallet is getting new capabilities. You can Tap to Cash to pay someone back by holding your phone together. It uses Apple Cash behind the scenes to charge your card and send the money to your friend or family member. Event cards are receiving an update with more information about your event, such as a stadium map.\n\nJournal, the recently introduced journaling app is receiving an update with insights and a new way to quickly find past entries. Game mode, a special mode that boosts device performances, is coming to the iPhone. It\u2019s no longer limited to macOS.\n\nThe Photos app is receiving its annual update but this one is bigger than usual. It\u2019s a complete redesign with a unified, single view. You get the good old photo grid at the top with years and months filters. There are buttons to filter out screenshots, zoom in and zoom out. It should be a bit easier to understand than the old design.\n\nBelow the grid, when you scroll down, you access collections that you can browse by topic: people, trips, favorite memories, etc. These memories were already available but hidden in a separate tab. But you can now reorganize collections, create pinned collections and customize the app to your favorite photos.\n\nIf you swipe left, you get an autoplaying video of favorite photos and videos. Apple is calling it the carousel and there will be new favorite moments to watch every day.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t exactly an iOS 18 feature, the next release of macOS is going to feature iPhone mirroring. If you\u2019re a Mac owner, you\u2019ll be able to mirror your iPhone screen to your Mac. You can interact with your iPhone using your trackpad and keyboard. iOS notifications will also show up on your Mac.\n\niOS gets a new AI brain\n\nAll those new features are nice quality-of-life updates, but they only tell part of the story around iOS 18. Apple also unveiled Apple Intelligence at WWDC, its new \u201cpersonal intelligence system\u201d that will be used across all of Apple\u2019s platforms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re tremendously excited about the power of generative models, and there are already some really impressive chat tools out there that perform a vast array of tasks using world knowledge, but these tools know very little about you or your needs,\u201d Federighi said.\n\nApple Intelligence will enable your iPhone to understand languages and images on your device. It will be able to take actions based on your personal context.\n\nAnd it starts with a new notification system. Your iPhone prioritizes your notifications that are more important. There\u2019s a new smart focus mode that also lets you device decide to hide notifications automatically. But it expands to many areas of the operating system. If you\u2019re writing something in Notes, Mail, Pages or third-party apps, Apple Intelligence can also help you write more clearly and make less mistakes. It\u2019s a system-wide writing tool that helps you communicate more effectively by rewriting your text. Apple showed a cover letter as an example but users can also select a large block of text and ask Apple Intelligence to summarize the text.\n\nIn the Mail app, you can generate smart replies without having to type anything. Apple Intelligence will ask you basic questions, such as if you want to go this event or not. In the email list, Apple is rewriting the email previews to summarize the content of the email in just a couple of lines. There is a new feature to summarize the content of your inbox too.\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nApple intelligence also adds new capabilities for images, from photos to emojis and GIFs. You can create AI-generated images with your friends and family members (just like Easel, a third-party app created by former Snap engineers and that we covered). It is based on the photos on your device and you can select between different styles, such as animation movie or illustration.\n\nThe company also unveiled Genmoji. These are emojis that you generate with a prompt and you can use in the Messages app. You can also generate emojis that look like your friends based on your photo library.\n\nThese AI-generated images will live in a new Image Playground. It will be available as an overlay on top of your app, such as Messages. But Apple is also going to ship a dedicated Image Playground app. Third-party developers will also be able to access and play with this Image Playground.\n\nPhoto editing in the Photos app has also been updated with a new AI-powered cleanup tool. These new AI capabilities also let you search through your library to find something very specific \u2014 it could be something that happens in the middle of a video.\n\nOf course, Apple Intelligence will also boost Siri\u2019s capabilities. You can say things like \u201cfind this file that Arthur shared with me last week\u201d or \u201cshow me photos of Tim and me\u201d.\n\nWhile Siri has been around for many years, it\u2019s not great. Apple is also updating Siri\u2019s design. When you talk to Siri, it adds a line around your screen to show that you\u2019re talking to Siri without hiding anything on your screen. You can get a weather pop-up, create an event or get instructions to send emails at a later date.\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nSiri will have the ability to take hundreds of new actions in and across apps. For instance, you can find an old photo from a family trip, tell Siri to make it pop more and add it to a note without touching your device. It\u2019s a new interaction method based on App Intents, a framework that is already used for Siri, Shortcuts and other automation features. Third-party developers can build their own App Intents.\n\nIt will be interesting to test this new version of Siri when it\u2019s available; the demos worked well in Apple\u2019s prerecorded video. If you want to type with Siri, you can double tap the multitasking line at the bottom of the phone to pull up a conversation with Siri. This could be useful for multi-step requests like in ChatGPT.\n\nApple said that the company has built a ChatGPT integration powered by the GPT-4 model. It is built into Siri and the new system-wide writing tools. You\u2019ll need to accept to share information with OpenAI when you want to talk to ChatGPT. All of Apple Intelligence\u2019s feature will be available for free for now if you have an iPhone 15 Pro or later. You don\u2019t need to create an OpenAI account to use the feature, but you can log in to unlock ChatGPT Plus features. The company says that it plans to integrate with other models in the future.", "image_links": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-ios18-homescreen-02.jpg?resize=1200,675", "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-unveils-ios-18-with-more-customization-options/", "Summary": "- iOS 18 focuses on AI with Apple Intelligence, a new personal intelligence system that understands languages and images, prioritizes notifications, helps with writing, and adds new capabilities to Siri.\n- Apple Intelligence integrates ChatGPT into Siri and system-wide interactions, allowing users to interact with the AI model without needing an OpenAI account.\n- iOS 18 also includes several new features and updates, such as customizable icons, a redesigned Photos app, a new Journal app, and RCS support for Messages.", "revised_title": "iOS 18: New Features and AI Integration"}, {"title": "Smart Script in iPadOS 18 will clean up your handwriting when using an Apple Pencil", "content": "Apple announced at WWDC 2024 on Monday that iPadOS 18 will include a new \u201cSmart Script\u201d feature that will clean up your handwriting when using an Apple Pencil to write in Notes.\n\nWith Smart Script, Apple says it\u2019s making handwriting your notes even smoother and straighter.

Snowflake has said little to date about the attacks, only that a \u201climited number\u201d of its customers are affected. The cloud data giant has more than 9,800 corporate customers, like healthcare organizations, retail giants and some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies, which use Snowflake for data analytics.\n\nSo far, only Ticketmaster and LendingTree have confirmed data thefts where their stolen data was hosted on Snowflake. Several other Snowflake customers say they are currently investigating possible data thefts from their Snowflake environments.\n\nMandiant said the threat campaign is \u201congoing,\u201d suggesting the number of Snowflake corporate customers reporting data thefts may rise.\n\nIn its blog post, Mandiant attributed the account hacks to UNC5537, an as-yet-unclassified cybercriminal gang that the security firm says is motivated by making money. The gang, which Mandiant says includes members in North America and at least one member in Turkey, attempts to extort its victims into paying to get their files back or to prevent the public release of their customers\u2019 data.\n\nMandiant confirmed the attacks \u2014 which rely on the use of \u201cstolen credentials to access the customer\u2019s Snowflake instance and ultimately exfiltrate valuable data\u201d \u2014 date back to at least April 14, when its researchers first identified evidence of improper access to an unnamed Snowflake customer\u2019s environment. Mandiant said it notified Snowflake to its customer account intrusions on May 22.\n\nThe security firm said the majority of stolen credentials used by UNC5537 were \u201cavailable from historical infostealer infections,\u201d with some dating as far back as 2020. Mandiant\u2019s findings confirm Snowflake\u2019s limited disclosure, which said there wasn\u2019t a direct breach of Snowflake\u2019s own systems but blamed its customer accounts for not using multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n\nLast week, TechCrunch found circulating online hundreds of Snowflake customer credentials stolen by malware that infected the computers of staffers who have access to their employer\u2019s Snowflake environment. The number of credentials available online linked to Snowflake environments suggests an ongoing risk to customers who have not yet changed their passwords or enabled MFA.\n\nMandiant said it has also seen \u201chundreds of customer Snowflake credentials exposed via infostealers.\u201d\n\nFor its part, Snowflake does not require its customers to use by default or enforce the security feature\u2019s use.

It lets you buy a share in a property that it manages on behalf of shareholders and lets you earn a slice from the monthly rentals. If the property gets sold, the investors get a share of the profit as well.

About 12% of its customers are from the U.S., Canada and the U.K.\n\nStake has been planning to expand beyond Dubai for a while now \u2014 it had originally announced its entry into Saudi Arabia and Egypt in 2022, but deferred those plans citing economic volatility. Earlier this year, the company partnered with U.S.-based private investment platform Republic to attract more overseas investors.\n\nAnd to entice more international investors, the startup, in partnership with the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), offers investors who commit at least AED 2 million (~$545,000) a golden visa (a 10-year renewable residency visa) in Dubai. That program was introduced in 2019 to attract foreign investment into the region, and initiatives like this have reportedly helped foreign nationals drive real estate investments in the region.\n\nThe company says it returns roughly 4%-7% to its customers through rental income. Tabbara, who serves as co-CEO with Mahmassani, told TechCrunch that the company has paid $4.5 million worth of rental income to its customers so far. He added that the average investment in properties comes to $1,500, and on average, customers invest a total of $5,600 through the platform.\n\nEntering Saudi Arabia\n\nStake claims it has surpassed Dubai-based fractional property investment platforms like Smartcrowd, but it will be starting afresh in Saudi Arabia.\n\nSaudi Arabia already has companies like Awaed and Aseel, which let customers invest in properties through funds. Historically, only Saudi nationals have been able to have freehold ownership of properties in the country. Property investment companies therefore set up special purpose vehicles through which they let investors buy real estate.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia has properties that are recently completed and under development that are worth billions. We are going to use [our] experience to offer a similar unified product for investment in Saudi Arabia within the same app,\u201d Mahmassani said.\n\nMahmassani noted that Stake aims to break even in Dubai by the end of this year and be profitable by next year. The startup is also exploring partnerships to let people from the Middle East invest in properties in countries like the U.S.", "image_links": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Founders-1-from-Google-Drive.jpg?resize=1200,960", "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/stake-raises-14m-to-bring-its-fractional-property-investment-platform-to-saudi-arabia-abu-dhabi/", "Summary": "- Dubai rents and sales have increased by 23% and 18% respectively in 2024, and this trend is expected to continue in the coming years.\n- This has led to a spillover of demand into neighbouring Abu Dhabi, which has likely attracted investment from the city's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment Company, into Stake, a Dubai-based fractional property investment platform.\n- Stake has raised $14 million in a Series A round to expand its operations in the UAE and enter the Saudi Arabian market in the coming months.\n- The company offers a simple process for property investors to buy a share in a property it manages, earning them a slice of the monthly rentals and potential profit if the property is sold.\n- Stake has over 200 properties under management and plans to break even in Dubai by the end of 2024, with profitability expected in 2025.", "revised_title": "Stake Raises $14M Series A to Expand its Fractional Property Investment Platform in the Middle East"}, {"title": "Apple gives Siri an AI makeover", "content": "Siri got a makeover at Apple\u2019s WWDC 2024 in Cupertino, courtesy of the tech giant\u2019s overarching generative AI push this year, called Apple Intelligence.\n\nSiri is now more natural, more relevant and more personal \u2014 and it has a new look, including a revamped icon.

In a series of posts on X, the Tesla, SpaceX and xAI exec wrote that \u201cif Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level,\u201d Apple devices would be banned from his businesses and visitors would have to check their Apple devices at the door where they\u2019ll be \u201cstored in a Faraday cage.\u201d\n\nHis posts seem to misunderstand the relationship Apple announced with OpenAI or at least attempt to leave room for doubt about user privacy. While Apple and OpenAI both said that users are asked before \u201cany questions are sent to ChatGPT,\u201d along with any documents or photos, Musk\u2019s responses indicate he believes OpenAI is deeply integrated into Apple\u2019s operating system itself and therefore able to hoover up any personal and private data.\n\nIn iOS 18, Apple said people will be able to ask Siri questions, and if the assistant thinks ChatGPT can help, it will ask permission to share the question and present the answer directly. This allows users to get an answer from ChatGPT without having to open the ChatGPT iOS app. Photos, PDFs or other documents you want to send to ChatGPT get the same treatment.\n\nMusk, however, would prefer that OpenAI\u2019s capabilities remain bound to a dedicated app \u2014 not a Siri integration.\n\nResponding to VC and CTO Sam Pullara at Sutter Hill Ventures who wrote that the user is approving a specific request on a per-request basis \u2014 OpenAI does not have access to the device \u2014 Musk wrote, \u201cThen leave it as an app. This is bullshit.\u201d\n\nPullara had said that the way ChatGPT was integrated was essentially the same way the ChatGPT app works today. The on-device AI models are either Apple\u2019s own or those using Apple\u2019s Private Cloud.\n\nMeanwhile, replying to a post on X from YouTuber Marques Brownlee that further explained Apple Intelligence, Musk responded, \u201cApple using the words \u2018protect your privacy\u2019 while handing your data over to a third-party AI that they don\u2019t understand and can\u2019t themselves create is *not* protecting privacy at all!\u201d\n\nHe even replied to a post by Apple CEO Tim Cook, wherein he threatened to ban Apple devices from the premises of his companies if he didn\u2019t \u201cstop this creepy spyware.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s patently absurd that Apple isn\u2019t smart enough to make their own AI, yet is somehow capable of ensuring that OpenAI will protect your security & privacy!\u201d Musk exclaimed in one of many posts about the new integrations. \u201cApple has no clue what\u2019s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI. They\u2019re selling you down the river,\u201d he said. While it\u2019s true that Apple may not know the inner workings of OpenAI, it\u2019s not technically Apple handing over the data \u2014 the user is making that choice, from the sound of things.\n\nApple also announced another integration that would allow users to have access to ChatGPT system-wide within Writing Tools via a \u201ccompose\u201d feature. For instance, you could ask ChatGPT to write a bedtime story for your child in a document, Apple suggested. You could also ask ChatGPT to generate images in a number of styles to complement your writing. Through these features, users will essentially be accessing ChatGPT for free without the friction of having to create an account. That\u2019s great news for OpenAI, which will soon have a massive influx of requests from Apple users.\n\nApple users may not understand the nuances of the privacy issues here, of course \u2014 which is what Musk is counting on by making these complaints. If users could set their own preferred AI bot as the go-to for Siri requests or writing help, like Anthropic\u2019s Claude or \u2014 say, xAI\u2019s Grok \u2014 it\u2019s doubtful that Musk would be yelling this loudly about the dangers of such an integration. (In fact, Apple just hinted that Google Gemini could be integrated in the future, in a post-keynote session.)\n\nIn its announcement, Apple says that users\u2019 requests and information are not logged, but ChatGPT subscribers can connect their account and then access their paid features directly within Apple\u2019s AI experiences.\n\n\u201cOf course, you\u2019re in control over when ChatGPT is used and will be asked before any of your information is shared. ChatGPT integration will be coming to iOS 18 iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia later this year,\u201d said Apple SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi. The features will only be available on iPhone Pro 15 models and devices that use M1 or newer chips.\n\nOpenAI reiterated something similar in its blog post, noting that \u201crequests are not stored by OpenAI, and users\u2019 IP addresses are obscured.

At least, that\u2019s what happened to the founders of Kelvin, a French startup that is using computer vision and machine learning to make it easier to audit homes for energy efficiency.\n\nCl\u00e9mentine Lalande, Pierre Joly and Guillaume Semp\u00e9 started looking at home energy efficiency audits because renovations are going to have a massive impact on reducing energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. But, like the rest of the construction industry, most companies in this space don\u2019t use technology to improve their processes.\n\n\u201cThere are 300 million homes to renovate over the next 30 years in Europe,\u201d Lalande, Kelvin\u2019s CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cBut the construction industry is the second least-digitized sector after agriculture.\u201d\n\nIn France, the National Housing Agency (ANAH) has set an ambitious goal of reaching 200,000 renovated homes in 2024 alone. But craftspersons simply can\u2019t keep up, and it hurts the climate as a result. More generally, the regulatory landscape is favorable for this kind of startup in Europe.\n\nFounded in October 2023, Kelvin is a pure software play. The company doesn\u2019t want to build a marketplace of service providers, and unlike Enter, another home energy assessment startup based in Germany that TechCrunch covered, it doesn\u2019t want to be a customer-facing product either.\n\nInstead, the startup has put together a small team of engineers to create its own AI model specialized in home energy assessments using machine learning. The company uses open data, such as satellite images, as well as its own training dataset with millions of photos and energy assessments.\n\n\u201cWe compute more than 12 proprietary, semi-public or open data sources that provide information on the building and its thermal performance. So we\u2019re using fairly standard segmentation techniques, analyzing satellite images with machine learning models to detect specific features, such as the presence of adjoining buildings, solar panels, collective ventilation units and so on,\u201d Lalande said.\n\n\u201cWe also do this on data we collect ourselves. We\u2019ve developed a remote inspection tool with a bot that tells the person who is in there, the photos and videos they should collect,\u201d she added. \u201cWe then have models that count radiators in videos, detect doors, detect the ceiling height, and will determine the type of boiler or the ventilation unit.\u201d\n\nKelvin doesn\u2019t want to use 3D technologies like lidar because it wants to build a tool that can be used at scale. It lets you use normal photos and videos, which means that you don\u2019t need a recent smartphone with a lidar sensor to record a room\u2019s details.\n\nThe startup\u2019s potential clients could be construction companies, the real estate industry or even financial institutions that want to finance home renovation projects \u2014 financiers, in particular, might be looking for accurate assessments before they make a decision.\n\nIn the company\u2019s first tests, its home energy assessments have been accurate within 5% of old-fashioned assessments. And if it becomes the go-to tool for these audits, it will become much easier to compare one home to another and one renovation to another.\n\nThe startup has now raised \u20ac4.7 million ($5.1 million at today\u2019s exchange rate), with Racine\u00b2 leading the round and a non-dilutive investment from Bpifrance.

What\u2019s more, they like companies that focus on consumers, whose fickle attitudes can add another layer of complexity to any business plan. Oh, and they decided to raise their sixth flagship fund at a time when limited partners have grown more miserly.\n\nTurns out it hasn\u2019t been a bad strategy. Collaborative recently raised $125 million for its sixth flagship fund, the firm exclusively told TechCrunch, completing the process in just over 90 days.\n\n\u201cThis fundraising environment is tougher than any I\u2019ve seen since starting the firm well over a decade ago,\u201d founder and managing partner Craig Shapiro told TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cWe were motivated to fundraise because we think the \u201924 vintage is going to be a good one,\u201d he said. Because of the slowdown in venture funding, valuations have been more reasonable and firms have had more time to complete due diligence, he added. Plus, because consumer investing has gone out of fashion for years in the VC world, there\u2019s less competition. \u201cThose are two compounding factors that actually make us more excited to be investing right now,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile some LPs have been hesitant to commit given higher interest rates and political uncertainty, Shapiro said that Collaborative\u2019s investors didn\u2019t fall into that category. \u201cWhat we saw is that the more sophisticated LPs, who have a very long-term view, understand that narrative. They understand that markets ebb and flow,\u201d he said.\n\nThe firm had \u201csignificantly greater demand than we could accommodate,\u201d said partner Sophie Bakalar. Part of that could be the fact that Collaborative has recently returned capital to its LPs, Shapiro said. Some of the firm\u2019s earlier investments have enjoyed successful exits, including Reddit\u2019s recent IPO and Scopely\u2019s $4.9 billion acquisition by Savvy Games Group. \u201cWe have one LP that told us that they haven\u2019t received a distribution from any of their venture funds in almost 18 months. The fact that we were distributing capital set us apart.\u201d\n\nWhile Collaborative wouldn\u2019t disclose the names of its LPs, it did say that it has a range of investors, including endowments, foundations, high net-worth individuals, a large asset manager and \u201ca large Singaporean organization with a strong focus on PE and VC investments.\u201d The majority of its existing LPs committed to the new fund.\n\nAs a Collaborative flagship, the new fund will also be focused on seed-stage companies, with about half the fund set aside for first checks and the remainder reserved for follow-on investments.\n\nShapiro is particularly interested in exploring how emerging companies can address changing consumer spending habits. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to us that how people are spending their money, where they\u2019re keeping their money, how they\u2019re divvying it up, where they\u2019re investing it \u2014 those are all areas that we\u2019re excited about.\u201d\n\nThe other thread that ties Collaborative\u2019s portfolio together is climate. \u201cWe break out kind of climate sustainability as another category.

The deal had been expected to close in Q1 of this year.\n\nThe delay is important in part because of how high-profile this deal has been so far. It\u2019s been described as \u201cthe largest merger in African e-commerce\u201d by both companies. But even if neither company has specified the size and value of the deal, they are both significant players that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars collectively from several high-profile investors. How it develops becomes a barometer of the overall state of the B2B e-commerce market in the region.\n\nWhen the planned merger was first announced, the B2B e-commerce players were active in eight countries. Now, that number is down to six: Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, DRC, Morocco and Egypt, with scores of layoffs in the wake of that downsizing.\n\nThere is also now talk of a review of ownership stakes in the new, combined holding company. Initially, Wasoko was set to own 55% of the new entity, while MaxAB would retain 45% based on revenues at the end of December. We understand that this share is now under review due to the massive currency devaluation of the Egyptian pound in March. MaxAB, disadvantaged by its presence in Egypt, may agree to the revision as it urgently needs the merger to close due to its severely depleted runway, according to sources.\n\nBoth companies claim to have received additional investment, providing enough runway to reach profitability, yet sources say they are still in talks to raise follow-on funding after the merger is complete. Neither has provided details on new funds raised.\n\nAttracting new investors, in any case, could prove tough in the current funding climate (especially for the B2B e-commerce industry which has faced some reckoning over the past year and a half) unless both companies quickly adapt their operations, shifting focus from high top-line growth to profitable scaling by improving gross margins and potentially bringing on new services to expand their touchpoints with customers, such as more financial services and marketing offerings.\n\nThat or \u2014 perhaps more realistically \u2014 cut costs drastically by streamlining overlapping business structures.\n\nSo far, Wasoko and MaxAB have done that by laying off employees, parting ways with key executives and halting operations in certain markets. These recent moves suggest the new entity will likely serve fewer than the 450,000 retailers quoted during the merger announcement. For a point of comparison, Wasoko\u2019s website currently states that it has 50,000 retailers.\n\nAs the merger nears completion, the CEOs from both companies will continue as full-time executives but function in different roles.\n\nWasoko CEO Daniel Yu will concentrate on investor relations, HR and fundraising, while MaxAB CEO Belal El-Megharbel will handle internal matters such as tech and operations, according to sources familiar with their new responsibilities. El-Megharbel, as per sources, assumed control of operations in Kenya and oversaw significant restructuring within the new entity, leading to a reduction in monthly burn from $2 million to $500,000; gross merchandise value (GMV) also decreased as a result. Wasoko reported $300 million in annualized GMV in 2022.\n\n\u201cRegarding our merger with MaxAB, it is important to state that this is progressing as expected and in accordance with the initial terms. Mergers of this scale usually require an extensive period to finalize following the signing of initial terms, and the process is advancing as planned,\u201d a Wasoko spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cIn light of the ongoing nature of the merger, we are currently not in a position to comment on speculation surrounding its finer details. We strongly encourage all stakeholders to rely solely on official communications from our team for accurate information regarding our operations.\u201d\n\nTiger Global, Silver Lake, Avenir and British International Investment were among the high-profile investors that collectively injected over $240 million into Wasoko and MaxAB prior to this merger.\n\nHowever, 4DX Ventures, a pan-African investor that backed both companies in early and growth-stage rounds, is the firm overseeing the merger and facilitating ongoing discussions, per sources.\n\n\u201cWhile 4DX is a shared investor and board member of both companies, 4DX recognized its conflict of interest and, therefore, did not participate in core negotiations and decisions between the two companies,\u201d Wasoko countered.\n\nThe valuation of this new entity remains uncertain, but in Q4 2023, one of Wasoko\u2019s investors marked down its valuation to $260 million, TechCrunch previously reported.\n\nUpdated to highlight Wasoko\u2019s comments on the number of countries the new entity is currently active in and the role of shared investor 4DX during the merger talks.\n\nGot a news tip or inside information about a topic we covered?

And many rumors are swirling around the AI enhancements coming to iOS 18, and a potential second life for Siri.\n\nMeanwhile, new hardware has never been a guarantee at the software-focused event, though the company has made it a trend in recent years, courtesy of Apple Silicon updates and last year\u2019s big Vision Pro debut.\n\nThe most recent rumors, however, suggest that this will be an off-year for hardware, in spite of mounting pressure following a lukewarm reception for Apple\u2019s first swing at mixed reality and the decision to kill its electric car project.\n\nThough the centerpiece will be iOS 18, the company will also debut macOS 15, including some big design changes to perhaps the most useful app on the iPhone, Calculator. And you can bet that many of iOS 18\u2019s AI features will make their way to macOS 15, as well.\n\nTechCrunch will be reporting on the ground at Apple Park, bringing you the news as it happens.\n\nThis post was originally posted June 3, and has since been updated.", "image_links": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WWDC-stream-featured-update.jpg?w=1200", "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/watch-the-apple-intelligence-reveal-and-the-rest-of-wwdc-2024-right-here/", "Summary": "- Apple announced Apple Intelligence, its entry into the AI market, at WWDC 2024.\n- The event focused on software updates, including iOS 18, iPadOS, macOS 15, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS.\n- Rumors suggest that this year's WWDC will be an off-year for hardware, with the focus on software updates and AI features.", "revised_title": "Apple Unveils AI Platform \"Apple Intelligence\" at WWDC 2024"}, {"title": "Apple brings its GenAI \u2018Apple Intelligence\u2019 to developers, will let Siri control apps", "content": "Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s new generative AI offering, won\u2019t just be a consumer-facing feature; developers will be able to take advantage of the latest technology, too. In Apple\u2019s keynote address at WWDC 2024 on Monday, the company announced that developers would be able to integrate the experience powered by Apple Intelligence into their own apps.\n\nApple\u2019s SDKs (software development kits) have been updated with a variety of new APIs and frameworks that will allow app makers to do things like integrate the Image Playground \u2014 or GenAI image creation \u2014 with just a few lines of code. Apple showed off how an app like Craft could use this offering to make users\u2019 documents more visual by allowing them to add AI images.\n\nAI-powered writing tools will also be automatically available in any app that uses the standard editable text view. For this, Apple demonstrated how an app like Bear Notes would automatically be able to allow users to rewrite, proofread and summarize their notes.\n\nIn addition, Apple is building more ways for developers to take actions in apps with Siri.\n\nDevelopers who have already adopted SiriKit \u2014 an SDK for integrating Siri into their apps \u2014 will see immediate enhancements for many of Siri\u2019s new capabilities without any extra work on their part, Apple said. This includes areas like Lists, Notes, Media, Messaging, Payments, Restaurant reservations, VoIP calling and Workouts.\n\nIn its Developer keynote, Apple said that there are two new Siri capabilities that developers will be able to benefit from without additional work. First, Siri will be able to invoke any item from an app\u2019s menus. That means a user could say something like \u201cshow my presenter notes\u201d when in their slide deck or even something more conversational, like \u201cI need to see my speaker notes.\u201d\n\nSecondly, Siri will be able to access any text displayed on the page using Apple\u2019s standard text systems. This will allow users to reference and act on text on the screen. For instance, if you had a reminder or note to \u201cwish grandpa a happy birthday,\u201d you could just say \u201cFaceTime him\u201d to take action on that note.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple\u2019s App Intents framework, which allows for lightweight app-like interactions without the app being installed, will also gain access to Apple Intelligence.\n\nApple is defining new intents and making them available to developers across categories starting with a subset of categories including Books, Browsers, Cameras, Document Readers, File Management, Journals, Mail, Photos, Presentations, Spreadsheets, Whiteboards and Word Processors.\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nThese intents are defined and tested so they\u2019re easier for developers to adopt, Apple claims.\n\nWith the intents, a photo-editing app like Darkroom could leverage the Apply Filter intent so users could just say \u201cApply a cinematic present to the photo I took of Ian yesterday\u201d to have the app take action. More domains will be added in time.\n\nInitially, users will be able to develop with the Shortcuts app but over time, Siri will gain the ability to call the app intents in the supported domains.\n\nPlus, Apple shared in its keynote address, apps that fit an existing SiriKit domain will be able to benefit from Siri\u2019s enhanced conversational capabilities, like responding correctly even if you stumble over your words or understanding references to an earlier part of the conversation.\n\nSiri will also be able to search data from apps using a new Spotlight API that enables app entities to be included in its index. These entities refer to Apple Intelligence\u2019s semantic index of things like photos, messages, files, calendar events and more.\n\nAlso on Monday, the company announced its own password-manager app, AI-generated Bitmoji and Calculator for the iPad.\n\nThis post was updated after publication with more information from the Developer keynote.", "image_links": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-SiriKit-02.jpg?resize=1200,675", "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-brings-apple-intelligence-to-developers-via-sirikit-and-app-intents/", "Summary": "- Apple is releasing a new generative AI offering called Apple Intelligence, which developers can integrate into their apps.\n- Apple is updating its SDKs with new APIs and frameworks that allow developers to integrate AI-powered features like image generation and writing tools into their apps.\n- Apple is also enhancing Siri's capabilities, allowing it to access app menus, text on the screen, and data from apps using a new Spotlight API.", "revised_title": "Apple Integrates Generative AI and Siri Enhancements for Developers"}, {"title": "iPhones will soon text via satellite", "content": "Apple\u2019s emergency SOS feature has proven useful for a fair number of people whose cars break down (or tumble down) in areas with no signal.

The goal, of course, is to make your \u201ceveryday conversations more enjoyable.\u201d\n\nApple Intelligence will have an understanding of who you\u2019re talking with in a messaging conversation, so if you want to personalize that chat with a custom AI image, you can create one on the fly. Read more\n\nApple TV+\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nFor those of you who use Apple TV+, there is a new feature called InSight. The feature will allow viewers to learn actor names and song titles as they appear on the screen. Lauren Forristal writes that it\u2019s similar to Amazon\u2019s X-Ray technology, where Fire TV users get an overview of actor bios and behind-the-scenes information while watching TV shows and movies.\n\nWhat stands out about InSight, however, is its Shazam-like functionality, which highlights the song playing in the TV show or movie and gives users the option to add it to an Apple Music playlist to listen to later. Read more\n\nSiri\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nApple also made some enhancements to its smart assistant, Siri. These include adding some generative AI features that make Siri seem more natural and more personal. There\u2019s also a new glowing light. And, Siri can also handle stumbles in speech and better understand context. Plus, for those who would rather type, you can do that now. Read more\n\nApple Intelligence is here\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nThe new feature is called Apple Intelligence (AI, get it?). The company promised the feature will be built with safety at its core, along with highly personalized experiences.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications and more,\u201d CEO Tim Cook noted at WWDC Monday. \u201cAnd of course, it has to be built with privacy from the ground up together. All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence. It\u2019s personal intelligence, and it\u2019s the next big step for Apple.\u201d Read more\n\nThat covers the consumer side of things, but WWDC is a conference for developers, and Apple revealed how developers will soon be able to bring the Apple Intelligence experience into their software. A number of AI features will be added to existing SDKs, allowing for generative AI image generation, or new prompts to Siri, to allow devs to expand the Apple Intelligence footprint.

Now, the company introduced a Passwords app. Some of the features include a new column on the left that lets you more easily navigate your password collection. For instance, you can view all your passwords or just Wi-Fi passwords (a new addition), passkeys or codes that aren\u2019t related to a website or service.

Well, Apple\u2019s new Calculator for iPad app got everyone excited.\n\niOS\u2019 perennial tips calculating app is finally coming to the larger screen. The feature utilizes the additional screen real estate to bring new features that the company couldn\u2019t really jam into the iPhone. The biggest arrival here is the addition of Math Notes. The additional feature does the math for you. Read more\n\nmacOS Sequoia\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nThe latest operating system version is called macOS Sequoia.\n\nOne of the biggest features of this new OS is iPhone mirroring. Now, through macOS\u2019 Continuity feature, you can mirror your iPhone\u2019s screen and control it right from your Mac. Notifications on Mac pop you into iPhone mirror mode, and iPhone audio comes through the Mac as well, but the paired iPhone stays locked while in mirror mode. Read more\n\nOK, let\u2019s do a little deeper dive into iPhone mirroring. While Apple didn\u2019t detail many use cases for the feature, Sarah Perez writes that it seems it would make it easier to demo apps over video calls or in person, as users could move between a slideshow presentation and a live demo of the iPhone app by launching it as if it\u2019s another app on your Mac.

The new app introduces new navigation, new organizational features and other ways to discover your favorite photos, including those of friends, family, pets, trips and more.\n\nSome things to know: The new design will lead to less time searching for photos as it puts everything you need within easy reach.\n\nOne major change involves how the app has been unified into a single view with the photo grid at the top and the library, organized by theme, below. Read more\n\nTap to Cash\n\nOne of the more interesting additions is Tap to Cash, which is more or less what it sounds like, letting users pay for things by tapping together a pair of iPhones.\n\nAs Brian Heater writes, the feature is effectively an outgrowth of Apple Pay\u2019s longstanding Tap to Pay feature. Similarly, the new addition likely uses the device\u2019s NFC functionality. Apple notes that the feature transfers money without having to share any personal info \u2014 a nice added privacy element. Read more\n\niOS 18\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nUsers will now be able to lock an app when they hand over their phone to do things like show someone a picture or let them play a game. When you lock an app, if someone tries to tap your phone, they will be required to authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID or their passcode. While you have the app lock feature enabled, information from inside the app won\u2019t appear in other places, like search and notifications. Read more\n\nApple also shared some initial details for the upcoming major release of iOS, which is its operating system specifically designed for the iPhone. As expected, much of this involves artificial intelligence. Remember when icons were locked to the grid? Well, they can now be laid out however you want on your home screen so that they don\u2019t hide your background photos.\n\n\u201ciOS 18 is a big release that delivers more ways to customize your iPhone, stay connected and relive special moments,\u201d Apple SVP of software engineering Craig Federighi said. Read more\n\nSpeaking of icons, most of these updates are those long-requested functionalities, like the ability to set app icons and widgets wherever you want on the Home Screen, plus support for dark mode icons with different color schemes.

Another is a new navigation option: visionOS 2 lets you switch to the home screen by just tapping, or flip your hand over to bring up the control center with notifications, shortcuts and more. Read more\n\nOne of the bigger announcements with this includes the ability to turn existing images into spatial photos. The new feature utilizes machine learning to build out additional angles, marking a change from the existing method, which required images to be shot on an iPhone 15 Pro or the Vision Pro itself. Read more\n\nFor those of you outside of the U.S., the Vision Pro headset will be available in eight new countries. Read more\n\nUseful AI, not flashy AI\n\nApple has fallen behind its peers in the AI race, and it probably feels like it needs to pull out all the stops to impress fans and shareholders. But that shouldn\u2019t mean overpromising on features. Read more\n\nGenerative AI\n\nFor smart assistants: While rumors point to the company transitioning a number of employees to generative AI operations following its electric car implosion, all signs point to Apple having ceded a significant head start to the competition. As such, its most logical play is a partnership with a reigning powerhouse like OpenAI. Read more\n\nMaybe not for iPhone 15: Some other rumors say that when this generative AI comes into play, a limited number of older devices will also be able to run the system, including iPads and Macs running an M1 chip or higher and the iPhone 15 Pro.

Most importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications and more and of course, it has to be built with privacy from the ground up. Together. All of this goes beyond artificial intelligence. It\u2019s personal intelligence, and it\u2019s the next big step for Apple.\u201d\n\nSVP Craig Federighi added, \u201cApple Intelligence is grounded in your personal data and context.\u201d The feature will effectively build upon all of the personal data that users input into applications like Calendar and Maps.\n\nThe system is built on large language and intelligence models. Much of that processing is done locally according to the company, utilizes the latest version of Apple silicon. \u201cMany of these models run entirely on device,\u201d Federighi claimed during the event.\n\nThat said, these consumer systems still have limitations. As such, some of the heavy lifting needs to be done off device in the cloud. Apple is adding Private Cloud Compute to the offering. The back end uses services that run Apple chips, in a bid to increase privacy for this highly personal data.\n\nApple Intelligence also includes what is likely the biggest update to Siri since it was announced more than a decade ago. The company says the feature is \u201cmore deeply integrated\u201d into its operating systems. In the case of iOS, that means trading the familiar Siri icon for a blue glowing border that surrounds the desktop while in use.\n\nSiri is no longer just a voice interface. Apple is also adding the ability to type queries directly into the system to access its generative AI-based intelligence. It\u2019s an acknowledgment that voice is often not the best interface for these systems.\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nApp Intents, meanwhile, brings the ability to integrate the assistant more directly into different apps. That will start with first-party applications, but the company will also be opening up access to third parties. That addition will dramatically improve the kinds of things that Siri can do directly.\n\nThe offering will also open up multitasking in a profound way, allowing a kind of cross-app compatibility. That means, for instance, that users won\u2019t have to keep switching between Calendar, Mail and Maps in order to schedule meetings, for example.\n\nApple Intelligence will be integrated into most of the company\u2019s apps. That includes things like the ability to help compose messages inside Mail (along with third-party apps) or just utilize Smart Replies to respond. This is, notably, a feature Google has offered for some time now in Gmail and has continued to build out using its own generative AI model, Gemini.\n\nThe company is even bringing the feature to emojis with Genmoji (yep, that\u2019s the name). The feature uses a text field to build customized emojis. Image Playground, meanwhile, is an on-device image generator that is built into apps like Messages, Keynote, Pages and Freeform. Apple is also bringing a stand-alone Image Playground app to iOS and opening up access to the offering via an API.\n\nImage Credits: Apple\n\nImage Wand, meanwhile, is a new tool for Apple Pencil that lets users circle text to create an image. Effectively it\u2019s Apple\u2019s take on Google\u2019s Circle to Search, only focused on images.\n\nSearch has been built, as well, for content like photos and videos. The company promises more natural language searches inside of these applications. The GenAI models also make it easier to build slideshows inside of Photos, again using natural language prompts. Apple Intelligence will be rolling out to the latest versions of its operating systems, including iOS and iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia and visionOS 2. It\u2019s available for free with those updates.\n\nThe feature will be coming to iPhone 15 Pro and M1 Mac and iPad devices. The standard iPhone 15 will not be getting the feature, likely owing to limitations of the chip.\n\nAs expected, Apple also announced a partnership with OpenAI that brings ChatGPT to offerings like Siri. The GPT 4.0-powered feature utilizes that company\u2019s image and text generation. The offering will give users access without having to sign up for an account or pay a fee (though they can still upgrade to premium).\n\nThat\u2019s arriving for iOS, iPadOS and macOS later this year. The company says it will also be bringing integration to other third-party LLMs, though didn\u2019t offer much detail. It seems likely that Google\u2019s Gemini is near the top of that list.", "image_links": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-Apple-Intelligence-hero-240610.jpg?resize=1200,675", "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-is-the-companys-new-generative-ai-offering/", "Summary": "- Apple has launched Apple Intelligence, its ecosystem-wide generative AI offering, at WWDC 2024.\n- Apple Intelligence is designed to be intuitive, easy to use, and deeply integrated into Apple products, with a focus on understanding users' personal context while protecting their privacy.\n- The system is built on large language and intelligence models, with many running entirely on-device using Apple silicon.\n- Apple has also added Private Cloud Compute to handle more complex processing tasks while protecting user data.\n- Siri has been updated to be more deeply integrated into Apple's operating systems and now offers a text-based interface in addition to voice.\n- App Intents will allow Siri to integrate with first and third-party apps, improving its functionality.\n- Apple Intelligence will be available for free with the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and visionOS, and will be compatible with iPhone 15 Pro, M1 Mac, and iPad devices.", "revised_title": "Apple Unveils Apple Intelligence: Generative AI Across Its Ecosystem"}, {"title": "Apple is launching its own password manager app", "content": "While you can already use your iCloud account to store and sync passwords across your devices, it wasn\u2019t easy to figure out.

Barooah is now one of the firm\u2019s three partners focused on early stage.\n\nBarooah told TechCrunch that in some ways those business schools were right to tell her she was being unrealistic about her goals. She knew it would be hard to break into the relatively small industry with no network or contacts in Silicon Valley, but she\u2019s glad she didn\u2019t listen to them.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t deterred, but it did feel kind of impossible at one point,\u201d Barooah said. \u201cI was so removed from it. I didn\u2019t know the reality on the ground. I just knew what people wrote about in the papers.\u201d\n\nBarooah grew up far away from Silicon Valley in Guwahati, a small city, by India\u2019s standards, sandwiched between Bhutan and Bangladesh. Both her parents ran their own businesses. Her dad ran a chemical business, while her mom designed and sold furniture.\n\n\u201cMy parents, growing up, asked me, \u2018what kind of business do you want to start?\u2019 That is what the most successful people in India did,\u201d she said. \u201cThey always encouraged me to forge my own path and start my own company. I thought about that for a long time but there was nothing that excited me. If there was no idea that I was passionate about, the next best thing I could do was work with founders.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Barooah applied to U.S. business schools again after working as a consultant, and had better luck. She landed a spot at Wharton and said she catered all of her classes and extra curriculars around learning everything she could about the venture industry. She started talking to entrepreneurs, developing an investment thesis and cold-calling VCs to pitch it.\n\nAfter an estimated 50 cold calls, she landed an internship at New York-based Primary Venture Partners in 2019. She got another at Redpoint shortly after and was able to convert that into a full-time role and has been there ever since.\n\nWhile growing up with entrepreneur parents didn\u2019t introduce Barooah to venture capital, she thinks her upbringing makes her a better VC. She said seeing their day-to-day triumphs and failures helped show her just how hard it is to run a business and how to roll with the punches when things do go wrong.\n\n\u201cThey always fought against the odds and did what was necessary to keep their business going,\u201d Barooah said. \u201c[They taught me] this idea that you have to keep moving forward despite all odds and that it was supposed to be hard. If one of my companies has a setback, I know that it is just par for the course and something that can be overcome.\u201d\n\nBarooah\u2019s portfolio includes Dune Analytics, an Ethereum-focused platform for making on-chain data accessible; Offchain Labs, a startup that helps companies scale with Ethereum; and The Rounds, a delivery service focused on sustainability, among others. She has two new investments that have yet to be announced where she\u2019ll be taking board seats too.\n\nThe first few years as an investor taught her that the best VCs are flexible and willing to follow where the market is telling them to go. She spent her first few years backing blockchain and crypto companies, but now she\u2019s spending most of her time on vertical SaaS startups utilizing AI.\n\nBarooah said she\u2019s excited to keep expanding her portfolio and looks forward to this new role as partner and being there for the founders when they need help.\n\n\u201cI started my journey in venture four years ago and knew nothing,\u201d Barooah said. \u201cOver these four years, I\u2019ve shaped my judgment on what a good company is. It\u2019s not something I have perfected by any means, but I have a few more successes than I did when I first joined. That gives me more confidence to take on more contrarian bets, and in VC it\u2019s about believing in things no one else believes and being right.\u201d", "image_links": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Urvashi_RP_Headshots_2023_1651.jpg?w=1121", "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/how-urvashi-barooah-broke-into-venture-after-everyone-told-her-she-couldnt/", "Summary": "- Urvashi Barooah, despite being rejected from every MBA program she applied to in 2015, persevered and is now a partner at Redpoint, a venture capital firm.\n- Barooah's journey to venture capital involved cold-calling VCs, landing internships, and eventually securing a full-time role at Redpoint.\n- Her upbringing with entrepreneur parents instilled in her a resilience and understanding of the challenges faced by founders, making her a successful VC with a portfolio including Dune Analytics, Offchain Labs, and The Rounds.", "revised_title": "Urvashi Barooah's Journey from Rejected MBA Applicant to Venture Capital Partner"}, {"title": "Apple unveils macOS Sequoia", "content": "macOS got a few noteworthy upgrades at Apple\u2019s WWDC 2024 in Cupertino.
