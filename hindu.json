        "text": "A tribal couple, who had just lost their baby, had to walk 8 kilometres with the body up and down two hills from Vanija village of Mentada mandal in Vizianagaram district to China Konela hamlet of Ananthagiri mandal in Alluri Sitharama Raju (ASR) district, in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nSara Kothaiah and Sita, from the Konda Dora tribe, work at a brick-making unit at Kolluru in Guntur district, and wanted to take the body of their son, Sara Eswara Rao, to their native village at China Konela for the last rites. The one-and-a-half-year-old boy had asthma and was admitted to a hospital in Guntur, when things took a turn for the worse. He died at the hospital while undergoing treatment.\n\nThough an ambulance was arranged to carry the body, the driver dropped them at Vanija village, about 450 km away from Guntur, refusing to go further, because there was no direct road.\n\nBroken for locals, built-up for tourists\n\nSeveral people in this area face multiple problems on a daily basis due to the lack of an asphalt road connecting Vanija to Buruga and China Konela. In 2022, the authorities decided to develop a 15-km track (from Sunkarametta side), with cement concrete, but an 8-km stretch remains incomplete with gravel dumped on both sides and some portions developing cracks.\n\nEven experienced drivers steer clear of the road at night, to avoid accidents. According to sources, contractors in collusion with officials are allegedly siphoning off funds sanctioned for the laying of roads and other developmental work, leading to stalling of projects midway.\n\nSeventy-six years after Independence, the lives of tribal people living in ASR district has not changed much. The condition of those living in the interior and hilltop hamlets is even worse, with no electricity, meagre medical facilities, and hardly any access to safe drinking water.\n\nThe villagers are forced to stay indoors from dusk to dawn, fearing attacks by wild animals. In case of emergencies, they use the divitilu (fire torch) to see the road as well as drive away wild animals like bears and porcupines.\n\nSome areas among the verdant green hills and valleys have been developed though, leading tourists to Araku, known for its coffee plantations; and Lambasingi, known for its stunning views.\n\nThose who have been living on the hilly terrain for generations endure the biting cold in winter and often fall prey to seasonal diseases like cholera, typhoid, and diarrhoea, mainly due to poor sanitation and lack of safe drinking water.\n\nMany are forced to trek long distances to fetch water from distant streams, get their monthly ration, and even carry pregnant women and patients in dolis (stretchers) through the bushes and rocky terrain as ambulances cannot reach their hamlets in the absence of tarred roads. Children walk long distances through the hills and streams, risking their lives, to reach schools.\n\nThe challenges remain the same\n\n\u201cThere is electricity till Boddavalasa, about 10 km from Buruga hamlet. Politicians come here once in five years, just before the elections seeking our votes,\u201d said Appalaraju, 36, from Buruga. However, on the positive side, he said that with road construction beginning, \u201cTwo teachers, one from Bheemunipatnam and another from Vizianagaram, and a Bhasha (language) volunteer from Rompelli village, come to our hamlet and teach our children.\u201d\n\nHe said laying of the road from Buruga to Vanija in Vizianagaram district will cut down the distance people travel by about one-third.\n\n\u201cWe had approached the ST Commission Chairman, Collector, and MRO [Mandal Revenue Officer] in this regard, but no action has been taken yet,\u201d he added.\n\nAppalaraju said after cultivating the land for generations, \u201cIn 2011, some influential people in connivance with government officials deceived us and got our land transferred to their names.\u201d The tribals lodged a complaint with the Paderu Sub Collector in 2020 but there has been no action, he said.\n\nA borewell was sunk about nine months ago by the contractor hired by the Rural Water Supply (RWS) department, but there is no tap, rendering it useless. \u201cA well that was dug up several years ago goes dry in peak summer,\u201d he said.\n\nSomula Veerayya, 60, says she has lived here ever since she can remember.\n\n\u201cThose days, there were no roads, either towards Sunkarametta in ASR district or towards Vizianagaram district, from our village (Buruga). We used to trek two hills to reach Vanija village of Mentada mandal, and had to carry fire torches at night to keep leopards and bears away.\u201d Nothing has changed.\n\nAccording to the AP Eastern Power Distribution Company (AP EPDCL), mandal-wise data of services (as on April 3) released to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTG) shows that out of the 5,457 households, which do not have electricity, 4,158 were given access to it, and 1,299 are yet to get access in four mandals of Chintapalli Sub-Division.\n\nIn Araku sub-division, 258 power connections have not been released in the three mandals, and in Paderu Sub-Division, 514 services remain to be released. Total number of services yet to be released in Paderu Division is 2,071 as on April 3.\n\nBurugu, an interior hamlet of Alluri Sitharama Raju district, is about 23 km from Kasipatnam village. It has a population of 150 with 30 households, but no power. Tribals here, depend on cultivation of paddy, gantelu (pearl millet), and korralu (foxtail millet). There is a school (till Class V) sans a building, where teachers take classes under the shade of trees.\n\nIf children want to pursue education after Class 5, they travel all the way to Kasipatnam. As a result, many have dropped out of school.\n\nThere are a few electric poles and a supply line to provide solar power to the hamlet. \u201cThese were erected in 2015, but the solar panels and bulbs didn\u2019t function after some time, and were neither replaced nor repaired after that. There is no power in two hamlets under Rompilli panchayat and seven under NR Puram panchayat,\u201d said Appalaraju.\n\nTribal girls are averse to marrying boys from hamlets where there is no power, say some of the village heads. If they come from hamlets that have electricity, then most households have Dish TV connections and mobile phones.\n\nYouth from deprived hamlets, who have migrated to cities and towns, are unwilling to return to their hometowns even during holidays. Tribal girls who manage to finish school are not willing to stay in their villages anymore, says Appalaraju.\n\nPolling problems\n\nPeople from some of these hamlets have to travel long distances to cast their vote during Lok Sabha elections. They leave their homes around 6 a.m. to reach the nearest polling station, kilometres away from their hamlets.\n\n\u201cThe long trek in the hot sun deters several voters from exercising their franchise,\u201d said Govinda Rao, a member of the AP Girijana Sangham (APGS), an association of tribal people formed to protect their interests. On April 5, tribals of Madrebu village took out a 4-km procession, some on horses, to announce their message loud and clear that they would come out to vote in large numbers only if roads were laid to their villages.\n\nMadrebu hamlet, which comes under Ananthagiri mandal of ASR district, has 45 households belonging to the PVTG Kondhu tribe.\n\nThe village has 70 voters. While 50 of them had to reach Pedhakota panchayat headquarters, 30 km away, others were allotted the Velamamidi polling booth, 18 km away. Similarly, 170 voters from Dayarthi village had to travel 30 km to cast their vote.\n\n\u201cAnantagiri MRO B. Nagajyothi and Revenue Inspector P. Sankara Rao travelled to Madrebu and nearby hilltop villages on May 7 to interact with villagers. She ruled out the possibility of arranging a polling booth there, but assured us of providing transportation to the nearest polling booth,\u201d Govinda Rao said.\n\nOn polling day (May 13), a private mini van, arranged by a political party, carrying people of various villages of Pedha Kota panchayat in Ananthagiri mandal to the poll booth (no. 295) overturned near Kudia village, critically injuring three. According to the tribals, one person had died in a road accident on the same spot, three months ago.\n\nThey alleged that though the government was spending crores of rupees, engineering officials and contractors were siphoning off funds and failing to ensure quality work. Revenue officials should be held responsible for the accident, they said in unison.\n\nTwo days later, Govinda Rao, also the CPI-M district secretariat member, demanded the officials concerned hold a medical camp at Rachakeelam, a hilltop hamlet of Pinakota panchayat in Anantagiri mandal, where 12 people had fever for 10 days. The hamlet has no road connectivity and the sick have to be carried in dolis for 10 km to reach any kind of healthcare.\n\nThe tribals are forced to have contaminated water from a distant stream due to lack of a clean water source. Govinda Rao said that though a drinking water scheme was sanctioned for the village in 2022, and the authorities concerned released a fund of Rs. 8 lakh, and a pipeline and motor were laid, the engineer was transferred, and the electricity officials failed to provide a transformer. The Rural Water Supply (RWS) officials had also paid the money for provision of the transformer, he alleged.",

        "text": "The steep hike in toll charges is putting a financial burden on the vehicle users who travel frequently between Palasa and Visakhapatnam for they need to cross three toll plazas en route.\n\nThe toll charge for a car at Laxmipuram toll plaza near Palasa in Srikakulam district is \u20b9140, while the same at Madapam toll gate near Narasannapeta is \u20b995. The toll charge at Natavalasa toll plaza at Bhogapuram in Vizianagaram district is \u20b9105. A car owner who travels from Palasa to Visakhaptnam needs to pay \u20b9340 in total at the toll plazas.\n\nMotorists from Srikakulam need to cross three toll gates to reach Visakhapatnam. Earlier, the toll charges were between \u20b950 and \u20b970 per per car. However, the amount has gone up steeply and the rates are allegedly being fixed without the involvement of stakeholders. The charge for a bus or truck is \u20b9480 at Laxmipuram, \u20b9325 at Madapam and \u20b9360 at Natavalasa.\n\n\u201cThe hike in charges at the toll plazas by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) is weighing heavy on the pockets of the motorists. After the FASTag was introduced, double the charge is deducted if there is no sufficient balance in the FASTag wallet. A 100% fine is unacceptable,\u201d said Hanumanthu Lajapathirai, former president of Confederation of Andhra Pradesh Consumers\u2019 Organisations.\n\nMoreover, the toll charge is only 25% if the return journey is on same date. But it is 50% otherwise and this is another burden on the vehicle users, he pointed out.\n\n\u201cMany people living in remote villages use old cars in the absence of adequate bus facilities. The government has fixed toll charges irrespective of the vehicle\u2019s value. The toll charge is same for a car worth \u20b950 lakh and an old four-wheeler worth \u20b92 lakh. The toll charges need to be fixed according to the value of the vehicles,\u201d opined T. Ajay, a native of Palasa.\n\nCongress Srikakulam district president Pedada Parameswara Rao alleged that the BJP-led NDA government had put a heavy financial burden on the people under the guise of road maintenance.\n\nCPI(M) Srikakulam district secretary D. Govinda Rao said that all toll gates in Andhra Pradesh should be removed as the government had collected the road development expenditure long ago.",

        "title": "Kerala sounds warning on West Nile Virus before monsoon; neighbouring states on guard",
        "publish_date": "2024-05-17",
        "text": "Kerala\u2019s annual battle with vector-borne diseases has begun early this year, even before the South West monsoon, with West Nile Fever (WNF) being reported from several districts.\n\n(For top health news of the day, subscribe to our newsletter Health Matters)\n\nThe first official alert was sounded by the Health Department on May 7 and according to the IDSP report to date, the State has reported 20 suspected cases (only 10 cases confirmed so far) and two deaths are also suspected. Given that Kerala has been endemic for the WN virus for at least two decades and that 80% of cases are asymptomatic, for every officially reported case, there could be several unreported and asymptomatic cases in the community.\n\nIn symptomatic cases, patients usually have fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, nausea and vomiting, and sometimes, swollen lymph glands. As clinical symptoms of most mosquito-borne viral diseases are similar, the possibility of WN or JE is considered only when the patient exhibits symptoms of neuroinvasive diseases like encephalitis or meningitis, collectively known as Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES). Thus, because of the diagnostic difficulties in identifying WNF in its acute phase, only a few cases get recorded in the State\u2019s official surveillance mechanisms.\n\nDiagnostic difficulties\n\nOnly 1 in 150 cases affected by the WN virus gets a severe disease, and even fewer get encephalitis. WHO states that while serious illness can occur in people of any age, people over the age of 50 and some immunocompromised persons, like transplant patients, are at the highest risk of falling severely ill when infected with WNV.\n\nKerala\u2019s Director of Health Services, K. J. Reena, said that WNF has been in the official surveillance records of Kerala every year since 2011 and that cases are being reported from almost all districts now. Districts that have reported WN cases this year include the northern districts of Thrissur, Malappuram, Kozhikode, and Palakkad.\n\nAlso Read | Government issues advisory in wake of West Nile virus cases in Kerala\n\nThe principal vectors of the disease are mosquitoes of the genus Culex, generally found breeding in stagnant, large water bodies like paddy fields. WNV circulation is maintained in mosquito populations through vertical transmission (adults to eggs).\n\nIn a study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research in 2017, B. Anukumar, et.al. say that the first reported acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) outbreak in Kerala occurred in the Kuttanad region between January and February 1996, causing 105 cases and 31 deaths.\n\nExceptional features\n\nAlthough the Japanese Encephalitis virus (another highly pathogenic organism transmitted by mosquitoes and antigenically similar to WN) was reported to be an aetiological agent associated with the outbreak, there were some exceptional features noticed during the outbreak. The seasonality of the outbreak was different from the one known for JE in Kerala, and most patients were from adult age groups, whereas JE occurs mainly in children. Another outbreak occurred in 1997, causing 121 cases and 19 deaths. The role of WNV in AES cases was not ruled out during these reported outbreaks, Dr. Anukumar says.\n\nIn 2006, during the major Chikungunya epidemic in Alappuzha, one of the central districts of Kerala, abundant in paddy fields and prone to waterlogging, the possibility of the co-circulation of the WN virus was mooted because of the high mortality rate during the epidemic. However, NIV (National Institute of Virology, Pune) provided conclusive evidence about the major presence of the WN virus in the region in 2011 during an AES outbreak when 208 cases were reported.\n\nPublic health experts say that the fact that the northern districts too have begun reporting the presence of the WN virus frequently could be either due to improved diagnostic facilities or the fact that the WN virus itself has been spreading to more areas. Most cases of AES are still reported by the health system as AES/JE or JE-WN complex because only the plaque reduction neutralisation test (usually done only in NIV) can isolate the WN virus antibodies.\n\nThe WN virus is maintained in nature in a mosquito-bird-mosquito transmission cycle. More than 250 species of birds are reservoir hosts of WNV. \u201cIn Kerala, the presence of large stagnant water bodies and migratory birds provides an ideal eco system for the WN virus to thrive. In the era of climate change, when mosquito-borne diseases are emerging as major public health problems, it is important that the State establishes efficient surveillance systems on the One Health platform to identify new pockets where WN and similar arboviruses may emerge,\u201d points out T.S. Anish, a public health expert and Associate Professor of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Manjeri.\n\nAvian reservoir\n\n\u201cMembers of the crow family are said to be particularly susceptible to this virus. All our information on the WN virus is based on Western medical literature. Have there been any studies to identify if our common crow could be spreading any viruses?\u201d Dr. Anish wonders.\n\nKerala\u2019s health department, while issuing a public health alert on WN fever and asking people to seek protective measures to prevent themselves from mosquito bites, perceives WN virus to be a lesser villain because of the low mortality profile of the disease, when compared to JE or dengue. The fatality rate in JE clinical cases ranges from 20 to 30%, with neurologic or psychiatric sequelae observed in 30\u201350% of survivors. In contrast, WNV rarely turns fatal.\n\nThe health department also contends that unlike dengue fever, which is spread rapidly and efficiently by Aedes mosquitoes, the WN virus does not cause huge outbreaks. Viremia due to WN virus is transient in humans, and hence Culex mosquitoes cannot transmit the virus efficiently to more people.\n\nEven though WN virus causes fatal encephalitis only in about 1% of infections, the neurological sequelae left behind by the virus, regardless of the severity of the infection in affected people, is not something that can be discounted. Neurological sequelae reported by doctors post WN infection include cognitive dysfunction, memory loss, seizure episodes and motor deficits. In the April 2016 issue of the Journal of Medical Virology, a follow-up study by Dr. Anukumar on the outcomes of WN encephalitis in 30 patients, one year after the 2011 outbreak in Alapuzha, pointed to several issues ranging from fatigue to reduced use of limbs. The patients also had probable risk of poor cognition (29.41%) and dementia (57.14%), the study reported.\n\nIt suggested that WN infection prevention efforts should focus on those over 60 years, especially those with co-morbidities. There are Western studies that report that in patients with and without diagnosed WN neuroinvasive disease, there are long-lasting neurological sequelae that can mimic neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nIll effects persist\n\nAnother 2010 study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases suggested that in some people, WNV may persist in the kidneys, even 1 to 6 years after infection, and could possibly result in chronic kidney disease. Creating awareness among the public on the risk of exposing themselves to mosquito bites and encouraging them to adopt personal protective measures might be the best way to reduce risk of infection in the community.\n\nHowever, the lack of systematic epidemiological and entomological surveillance systems could prove costly in the future, especially when it is well known that viruses can adapt to new hosts or mutate to increase virulence, public health experts warn. Expertise in entomology is scarce even at the national level and there is no one to impart training to those entering health service as entomologists.\n\nThe State lags when it comes to comprehensive and integrated vector control. and the term \u201cvector control\u201d has been essentially reduced to just Aedes control now. Source reduction measures are effective only against Aedes mosquitoes which spread dengue/Chikungunya and Zika. We still have a huge burden of filariasis, malaria, and WN/JE because vector control measures are nil when it comes to other mosquito species,\u201d points out a senior scientist formerly associated with the National Centre for Disease Control.\n\nThe increase in climate-sensitive zoonotic diseases in recent times is a warning that the nation and various States have to invest in science and bring more focus to the One Health approach to dealing with infectious diseases.",

        "title": "The death and disappearance of migrant workers",
        "publish_date": "2024-05-17",
        "text": "On May 15, Udal Yadav, a 37-year-old migrant worker, sat outside the mortuary of the government-run Gandhi Hospital in Secunderabad. He was waiting for the post-mortem results of his relatives, who were victims of a construction-site wall collapse at Bachupally in Hyderabad, after the recent rains.\n\nSeven people, including a four-year-old child, died on May 8, after the wall collapsed on the migrant workers\u2019 tenements. All of them hailed from Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and West Bengal. It has put the spotlight on the risks that migrant workers are forced to take, when they leave their homes and come to work, unprotected by State or employer, in chaotic urban centres.\n\n\u201cIt has been some days since the accident, yet the building owner where we were employed, has not reached out with any assistance. I earn Rs. 800 daily, but today, I could not work as I have been here at the hospital. I am not sure how I will make up for this loss,\u201d Yadav says.\n\nBy 9 p.m., the doctors handed over the bodies to the police, who in turn gave them to the friends and families of the deceased. Transporting the bodies to their hometowns would take Rs. 50,000.\n\nOne worker remarked, \u201cIf I labour on a site for six months, this is all I will be able to save.\u201d The families and fellow workers of the victims were unable to proceed and transport a single body due to the exorbitant transportation expenses.\n\nWhile the workers engaged in dialogue with the police, a man approached them and handed over a letter written by the building owner. Unable to understand Telugu, the workers sought assistance from the police to translate its contents.\n\nAccording to the letter, on behalf of the Twin Cities\u2019 Contractors\u2019 Association, the building owner offered his condolences and proposed a compensation of Rs. 11.5 lakh per victim.\n\n\u201cImmediate assistance of Rs. 50,000 will be provided to facilitate the transportation of bodies to their native villages, with the remaining Rs. 11 lakh to be disbursed via cheque upon presentation of a family member\u2019s identity proof,\u201d a policeman said, while reading the letter aloud.\n\nFinally, after spending almost 12 hours outside the mortuary, the workers left.\n\nThis is not the first time that migrant workers had died in Hyderabad. In March 2022, up to 11 from Bihar were killed in a blaze at a timber depot. Today, it is difficult to find the site of the fire mishap that claimed their lives. There are no memorials, nothing to remember them by.\n\nWithout a permanent place to stay, a regular source of income, and knowledge of the local language, migrants live on the edge while the bricks they lay become landmarks in cities. The lives of migrant workers remain unchanged, whether they are hired to construct a three-floor apartment or a towering 40-storeyed high-rise.\n\nToiling from dawn to dusk\n\nWork on a construction site begins at 8 a.m., extending up to 5 p.m. mostly, and does not stop for temperatures soaring to 40 degrees Celsius. Basic amenities \u2014 clean water, sanitation, and electricity \u2014 are missing, leaving them vulnerable to disease and discomfort. Falling ill is a luxury they cannot afford; a single day off from work can mean a missed meal for their families. At a construction site, where babies lie in the sun, dust and debris is everywhere.\n\nAccording to Telangana\u2019s Department of Labour, Employment Training and Factories, there are an estimated 5 to 6 lakh migrant workers currently employed in different parts of the State. The number was eight to 10 lakh before the COVID-19 pandemic, said an official.\n\nOn the Yousufguda-Madhura Nagar road, hundreds of labourers congregate along the roadside, hopeful of a contractor offering them some work, ensuring a day\u2019s sustenance. These labourers not only include construction workers but also individuals skilled in carpentry, painting, and plumbing.\n\n\u201cI live in Krishna Nagar with my husband and his two brothers. We come here daily hoping for work, but, not every day brings us joy,\u201d shared Sunita, a labourer hailing from Samastipur, Bihar. \u201cIn this relentless heat, we endure hours of waiting until someone approaches us with work.\u201d\n\nShe highlighted the challenges faced by women: \u201cLife is difficult for everyone, but men have the advantage of diversifying into painting and carpentry. In contrast, women like us are often given the repetitive task of transporting materials from one location to another. Also, we are paid less than men.\u201d\n\nAmeen Shah, who hails from Balrampur in Uttar Pradesh, is presently employed as a worker at a 40-storeyed residential project at Abids. \u201cIf we work on such sites and don\u2019t have alternative accommodation, we are typically provided shelter within the premises,\u201d he explained. \u201cFor us, it becomes a home for the next few years as these projects usually take two to three years until completion.\u201d\n\nHowever, the issue of wages persists. Ameen said that his role as a Plaster of Paris (PoP) worker, while integral to the site, is not directly tied to the construction process, resulting in lower wages. He earns Rs. 500 per day. \u201cMy work commences once the walls or ceilings are prepared, and because of this, individuals in this line of work are paid less compared to other construction workers,\u201d he said.\n\nNow 35 years old, he recalled his journey since leaving his hometown at 20, to settle in Hyderabad. \u201cBack then, Hyderabad wasn\u2019t witnessing the emergence of such towering structures, and developers or builders weren\u2019t organised to provide support for workers like us,\u201d he reminisced.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started working, my daily wage was Rs. 65-Rs. 70. After 15 years of labour across different cities, I now earn Rs. 500 per day. Back then Rs. 65 was sufficient to make ends meet, unlike today\u2019s Rs. 500 per day,\u201d he added.\n\nAmeen currently lives in a rented accommodation at Himayat Nagar with his wife and their five-year-old child. \u201cIf I were alone, I could consider staying at the construction site, but I can\u2019t expose my wife and child to the constant dust and pollution there,\u201d he explained. \u201cOur house rent is Rs. 5,000 per month.\u201d Initially, his wife too worked at a construction site, but with no one to take care of their child, she now stays home with him.\n\nOn his last visit to his hometown, Ameen\u2019s 23-year-old cousin, Salman, joined him in Hyderabad to work together at the Abids site. \u201cI arrived in Hyderabad only six months ago, and since I am currently working as a site helper, my daily wage is Rs. 300,\u201d Salman said.\n\nSalman finished school in his hometown, but was unable to pursue higher studies due to financial constraints. Prior to arriving in Hyderabad, he engaged in various odd jobs in small towns near his village. \u201cInitially, I stayed with Ameen, but later, being single, I opted to move into the accommodation provided at the construction site,\u201d he said.\n\nMost of these workers did not visit their hometowns to vote for the Lok Sabha elections, citing the impracticality of such a decision when it comes to their livelihoods. The primary problems were the long travel time and logistical challenges. For instance, workers from Uttar Pradesh or Bihar would need to endure a two-day train journey to reach cities like Gorakhpur or Patna, and then proceed to their hometowns, before repeating the same arduous journey back to Hyderabad. \u201cMoreover, with peak travel season, even those who made reservations 120 days in advance, struggled to secure tickets,\u201d a worker said.\n\nWelfare moves\n\nIn 2014, the Telangana Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board (TBOCWWB) was established by the State government in accordance with Section 18 (1) of the Building and Other Construction Workers\u2019 (RE&CS) Act, 1996. The primary objective of the board is to advocate for the welfare of construction workers, ensuring they are provided with safe working conditions and essential facilities. Additionally, the board extends support for healthcare services and offers assistance in case of accidents or emergencies.\n\nThe board has classified 54 types of workers under the umbrella term \u201cconstruction worker,\u201d whereby registration with the board renders them eligible for various welfare schemes. A total of 11 such schemes are offered to these registered workers. These include financial assistance such as Rs. 30,000 under the Marriage Gift Scheme for unmarried women, Rs. 30,000 as maternity benefit for the wives of male workers, Rs. 6 lakh as relief for fatal accidents, and Rs. 80,000 as relief for fatal accidents for unregistered workers.\n\nNodal officer for Migrant Workers in Telangana L. Chaturvedi said, \u201cIn the Bachupally accident, the deceased workers were not registered with the board. Therefore, the government provided Rs. 50,000 as compensation along with Rs. 30,000 towards funeral expenses.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo register with the board, a worker only needs to pay Rs. 50 for a one-time membership, with an additional Rs. 60 for a five-year subscription, totalling Rs. 110. We consistently encourage contractors and builder associations in Hyderabad and throughout the State to ensure their workers are registered with us. Additionally, we conduct routine inspections at construction sites to verify compliance with the prescribed rules and regulations,\u201d said the officer.",

        "publish_date": "2024-05-17",
        "text": "The United Nations has revised upwards India\u2019s growth projections for 2024, with the country\u2019s economy now forecast to expand by close to 7% this year, mainly driven by strong public investment and resilient private consumption.\n\nThe World Economic Situation and Prospects as of mid-2024, released Thursday, said, \u201cIndia\u2019s economy is forecast to expand by 6.9% in 2024 and 6.6% in 2025, mainly driven by strong public investment and resilient private consumption. Although subdued external demand will continue to weigh on merchandise export growth, pharmaceuticals and chemicals exports are expected to expand strongly.\u201d\n\nThe 6.9% economic growth projections for India in the mid-year update is an upward revision from the 6.2% GDP forecast made by the U.N. in January this year. The U.N. World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) 2024 report that was launched in January had said that growth in India was projected to reach 6.2% in 2024, amid robust domestic demand and strong growth in the manufacturing and services sectors. The projection in January for India\u2019s GDP growth for 2025 remains unchanged at 6.6% in the latest assessment of the economic situation.\n\nThe update said that consumer price inflation in India is projected to decelerate from 5.6% in 2023 to 4.5% in 2024, staying within the central bank\u2019s two to six per cent medium-term target range. Similarly, inflation rates in other South Asian countries declined in 2023 and are expected to decelerate further in 2024, ranging from 2.2% in the Maldives to 33.6% in Iran. Despite some moderation, food prices remained elevated in the first quarter of 2024, especially in Bangladesh and India.\n\nConsumer Price inflation,\n\nannual % change Country 2023* 2024^ 2025^ India 5.6 4.5 4 Pakistan 30.9 23 12.6 Nepal 7.1 6.2 5.4 Bangladesh 9.6 8.5 6.8 Maldives 3 2.2 2 * - Partly estimates\n\n^ - Baseline scenario forecasts,\n\nbased on the UN DESA World\n\nEconomic Forecasting Model.\n\nIn India, labour market indicators have also improved amid robust growth and higher labour force participation, it said. India\u2019s government remains committed to gradually reduce the fiscal deficit, while seeking to increase capital investment.\n\nSouth Asia\u2019s economic outlook is expected to remain strong, supported by a robust performance of India\u2019s economy and a slight recovery in Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Regional GDP is projected to grow by 5.8% in 2024 (an upward revision of 0.6 percentage points since January) and 5.7% in 2025, below the 6.2% recorded in 2023. However, still tight financial conditions and fiscal and external imbalances will continue to weigh on South Asia\u2019s growth performance. In addition, potential increases in energy prices amid geopolitical tensions and the ongoing disruption in the Red Sea pose a risk to the regional economic outlook, it said.\n\nThe world economy is now forecast to grow by 2.7% in 2024 (an increase of 0.3 percentage points from the forecast in January) and 2.8% in 2025 (an increase of 0.1 percentage points).\n\nThe upward revisions mainly reflect a better outlook in the United States, where the latest forecast points to 2.3% growth in 2024 (an upward revision of 0.9 percentage points since January), and several large emerging economies, notably Brazil, India and Russia.\n\nIt noted that several large developing economies \u2013 Indonesia, India and Mexico \u2013 are benefiting from strong domestic and external demand. In comparison, many economies in Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean are on a low-growth trajectory, facing high inflation, elevated borrowing costs, persistent exchange rate pressures and lingering political instability. The possible intensification and spreading of conflicts in Gaza and the Red Sea add further uncertainties to the near-term outlook for the Middle East, the mid-year update said.\n\nGlobal trade is expected to recover in 2024. The early boost to trade flows in the first months of the year can be attributed to destocking of the inventory that piled up amid supply-chain disruptions in 2021-22. \u201cChina\u2019s foreign trade grew faster than expected in the first two months in 2024, driven largely by exports to emerging markets, particularly to Brazil, India and Russia,\u201d it said.\n\nHowever, persistent geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and disruptions in the Red Sea, and escalating cost of freight continue to pose challenges to global trade, it added.\n\nThe mid-year update said global economic prospects have improved since January, with major economies avoiding a severe downturn, bringing down inflation without increasing unemployment. However, the outlook is only cautiously optimistic. Higher-for-longer interest rates, debt sustainability challenges, continuing geopolitical tensions and ever-worsening climate risks continue to pose challenges to growth, threatening decades of development gains, especially for least developed countries and small island developing states.\n\nThe outlook for China registers a small uptick with growth now expected to be 4.8 per cent in 2024, from 4.7 per cent projected in January. China\u2019s growth is projected to moderate to 4.8% in 2024, from 5.2% in 2023. Pent-up consumer demand \u2013 released after the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions \u2013 has largely dissipated. While enhanced policy support is expected to boost investments in public infrastructure and strategic sectors, the property sector poses a significant downside risk to the Chinese economy, it said.",

        "title": "The happy, hopeful coffee farmers of Karnataka",
        "publish_date": "2024-05-17",
        "text": "Sanketh Appaiah, a young coffee planter in a village near Madikeri in north Kodagu, is now the proud owner of a new SUV thanks to the rising prices of coffee over the past three months. The 42-year-old is happily driving his new vehicle across the hilly terrain of the small district in south Karnataka.\n\nThe soaring prices of coffee beans, driven by a global shortage in crop production, have provided a ray of hope for coffee growers in Karnataka, which is the highest coffee-growing State in India. Currently, at a 15-year high, these prices are a boon for growers who have weathered a tumultuous decade.\n\n\u201cI own an 8-acre Robusta coffee plantation. For the first time in 15 years, the coffee price has increased, helping me to fulfil my plan of buying a new SUV this year,\u201d said a visibly thrilled Appaiah. Like him, many coffee planters who are experiencing good prices after a decade are investing in various assets, such as plots of land, apartments, houses, and new vehicles.\n\nA prominent cooperative bank in Kodagu received around 800 applications in a single day for vehicle loans in April. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the bank manager said, \u201cWe have never seen so many people applying for vehicle loans. This trend can be attributed to the increase in crop prices. At the same time, we are also noticing that farmers are repaying their loans on time this year, which is also due to the increase in coffee prices.\u201d Karnataka contributes 71% to the total production of coffee in India, followed by Kerala at 21% and Tamil Nadu at 5%.\n\nSome farmers holding on to produce\n\nAbubakr Ahmad, a coffee trader in Gonikoppa in south Kodagu, says that the price of a 50-kilo bag of Robusta beans has surged to nearly \u20b911,000. Robusta is the primary coffee variety grown in Kodagu. \u201cThis year marks a significant increase from the average prices seen since 2008 when the price of Robusta was between \u20b93,000 and \u20b94,000,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMany coffee growers have sold their coffee, while a few, especially large-scale planters, are holding onto their produce, anticipating a further increase in prices in the days to come. However, over the last two weeks, there has been a slight drop in prices,\u201d Ahmad added.\n\nK.G. Jagadeesha, CEO and secretary of the Coffee Board, said a significant increase in global demand was driven primarily by low production in Brazil, the world\u2019s leading coffee exporter. \u201cDespite poor yields, coffee production is expected to reach 3.54 lakh tonnes, a marginal increase over last year\u2019s production of 3.52 lakh tonnes, in India,\u201d he said.\n\nRemembering boom times\n\nPeople in the coffee-growing districts in Karnataka\u2014Hassan and Chikkamagaluru, besides Kodagu\u2014remember the 1990s when the price of coffee went up for the first time since 1942 when the Coffee Board was set up. This brought about many changes in the lifestyle of coffee growers. Brand new cars were spotted on the narrow lanes that led to estates in parts of Sakleshpur, Mudigere, Koppa, N.R. Pura, and Balehonnur.\n\nTo provide better schooling for their children, the planters invested in building houses in Hassan, Chikkamagaluru, and some other cities, in addition to fixing modern amenities in their rural farmhouses. They shifted to cities, travelling to their estates now and then. This was the period when the free-sale quota (FSQ) was introduced for coffee in 1992. Prior to that, growers had to sell their entire harvest to the Coffee Board. Liberalisation of the economy ushered in changes in the trading of the commodity.\n\nThis year, farmers in Hassan and Chikkamagaluru have not benefitted much since the primary variety grown there is Arabica, which has not seen as much of an increase in price as Robusta.\n\nSmall farmers still suffer\n\nThe prevailing price of coffee has prompted growers to recall the 1990s, but they warn that it might be a bubble and that farmers should be cautious. They also say rising prices should be weighed against escalating production costs.\n\nMany growers in Hassan and Chikkamagaluru districts argue that, ideally, the price of coffee should have gone up long ago. Surendra T.P., a coffee grower at Kesaganahalli in Sakleshpur taluk and director of the Karnataka Growers\u2019 Federation, said for a healthy, sustainable growth of the coffee sector, the growers should have got the current price in the early 2000s.\n\nBesides, the current increase in coffee prices has not helped small and medium growers. \u201cThe harvesting is done between December and February. By the end of February, nearly 80% of coffee had been sold. At that point, the price was around \u20b96,500 per bag of 50 kg. Only later did it cross \u20b98,000 per bag.\u201d\n\nGrowers are forced to sell their produce before February or March, as they have financial commitments to fulfil at the end of the financial year. They have to clear loans to maintain a good credit rating.\n\nPrice has gone up, but so has input cost\n\nDespite the euphoria over the prevailing prices, growers point out that the input cost has gone up at an alarming rate. Surendra feels the current increase in price has no significant value, given the rise in the cost of other essential items. \u201cWhen coffee was opened for free trade in the 1990s, the price of Robusta per 50 kg was around \u20b93,000. Briefly, it went up to \u20b910,000. Then, petrol was sold at \u20b914.75 per litre, and diesel at \u20b910 per litre. Now, compare the rate of increase in the prices of petrol and diesel with coffee in the last 30 years,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe cost of labour has increased over the years. Coffee growers pay more than what the workers get under the MGNREGA, but coffee plantations are not covered under crop insurance. The compensation paid during a drought or flood is negligible considering the investment made by the growers, they say, pointing to cycles of drought, flood, and landslides the district has witnessed over the past few years.\n\nPrakash Ponnanna, a coffee planter in Virajpet, Kodagu, pointed out that while large-scale growers have been able to mitigate the impact of drought through various water management measures, smaller growers are suffering.\n\n\u201cAlthough Kodagu is a hilly district where the river Cauvery, the lifeline of south India, originates, this year, the district is facing a severe drought and water shortage. The coffee, which requires irrigation, does not have adequate water. Hence, the production next year will be much less than this year. Whatever the price increase is, it will not benefit us much eventually,\u201d Ponnanna explained.\n\nLabourer shortage and other worries\n\nIn the last 10 years, coffee growers have struggled with low prices and high production costs, exacerbated by labour shortages and crop diseases. Consequently, many small and marginal growers abandoned cultivation and diverted their efforts towards real estate, tourism, or more lucrative crops like areca nut, black pepper, and avocado.\n\nAnother significant issue that coffee estates are facing is a labour shortage. According to planters, this year, there was a severe shortage of labour, leading to situations where many planters had no workers to harvest the crop, resulting in berries dropping to the ground.\n\n\u201cOver the past five years, we have faced significant labour shortages for coffee picking. Previously, labourers would come from north Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and parts of Mysuru. However, they have stopped coming as they find employment in cities, particularly in construction work. In the last three years, we have had people coming from Assam. This year, they did not come due to the general elections. As a result, we incurred losses as crops were not harvested. Hence, the price rise will not benefit us,\u201d rues Muthappa M.N., a planter in Virajpet.\n\nIn recent years, farmers in Kodagu, Hassan, and Chikkamagaluru have been facing man-elephant conflict. The elephant menace has left the community in constant worry. A majority of the people who died in elephant attacks were plantation workers. In Kodagu district alone, six people were killed in elephant attacks on coffee estates from January to date. Whenever a herd of elephants strolls through an estate, hundreds of coffee plants are damaged.\n\nManoj Mandappa, a coffee planter from Siddapura in Kodagu, said, \u201cIn the last three years, elephants have been destroying crops like coffee and banana. The authorities concerned have not been able to solve this issue.\u201d\n\nFor now though, Appaiah and farmers like him are happy with the surge in the price of coffee. \u201cIf the current price continues to remain in this range in the coming years and if we are blessed with a good crop, small planters like us will definitely see better days in future. This will enable us not only to make personal investments, like buying a car or a house but also to enhance our plantations. For example, I used to apply fertilisers only once a year for my coffee plants, but now I can afford to do this twice a year due to the good prices we have been receiving,\u201d Appaiah said.",

Ibu is one of Indonesia's most active volcanos, erupting more than 21,000 times last year.\n\nMore than 7,00,000 people lived on Halmahera island as of 2022, according to official figures. Indonesia, a vast archipelago nation, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\".\n\nLast month, Mount Ruang in North Sulawesi province erupted more than half a dozen times, forcing thousands of residents of nearby islands to evacuate. Its status has since been lowered to the second-highest alert level.",

        "title": "Why do even short spells of rain bring Bengaluru\u2019s trees tumbling down?",
        "publish_date": "2024-05-17",
        "text": "Following an extended period of drought lasting over five months, Bengaluru received its first spell of rain on May 6. Intermittent showers have continued in the following days, resulting in the inundation of several roads. What has been a matter of particular concern is the uprooting of trees and the breaking of branches, which is usually expected during the monsoon season.\n\nHow many trees\n\nAccording to data provided by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), from May 6 to May 15, complaints of close to 331 uprooted trees, and a total of 664 fallen branches were received by the civic body following pre-monsoon rains. The highest number of complaints about fallen trees was 92, from the R.R. Nagar zone and the lowest was from Dasarahalli with 11 complaints, till May 15.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu, BBMP\u2019s Special Commissioner for Forest and Estates, Preeti Gehlot, said that the civic body is finding it difficult to understand why trees are getting uprooted. \u201cWhile the tree uprooting cases are a few, it is mostly branches of trees that are falling or breaking due to rains. In the dry season, the tree canopy management goes on. Branches that are likely to break due to rain or based on complaints raised by public are trimmed. However, there are many trees that look very healthy from the outside but are not on the inside. It is difficult to understand and judge the health of the tree and predict which tree might fall, we are trying to understand why the felling of trees or breaking of branches are happening,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat handbook says\n\nExperts say that rapid concretisation and urbanisation are the major causes for the deteriorating health of Bengaluru\u2019s green life. According to the Urban Forestry Handbook by Bangalore Political Action Committe (B.PAC) that has been curated by inputs from tree experts from across the country, old Bengaluru was renowned for its expansive roads lined with avenue trees. Adjacent to these roads were broad parallel footpaths that accommodated tree planting, alongside stormwater drains positioned further out. Beyond these drains lay entrances and gates to buildings. However, with development and road widening, buildings came closer. This, coupled with a population surge, rapid urbanisation, and haphazard land-use planning during Bengaluru\u2019s IT boom in the 1990s, has led to a significant reduction in green spaces within the city. Research conducted by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) revealed a 66% decline in vegetated cover in Bengaluru as of 2012.\n\nVijay Nishanth, a contributor to the Urban Forestry Handbook, founder of Vruksha, and a tree expert, also known as \u201ctree doctor\u201d says the reason for trees getting uprooted in Bengaluru is concretisation and low maintenance of the health of the trees spread across the city.\n\nInappropriate works\n\n\u201cIn old Bengaluru, like the 80s, the trees were planned and planted appropriately. However, haphazard urban growth has started affecting the trees. Inappropriately planned civic work like construction of drainage systems have led to cutting of tree roots. Concretisation of pavements has also affected the roots of the trees. Even the new trees planted over the last few years are falling, as they do not have enough root space. There is no coordination between the major civic bodies in the city, which is leading to the felling of the trees. The BBMP must release a manual or a notice, which explains how much space must be left around a tree wherever infrastructure is being built,\u201d he says.\n\nNishanth says that another reason for trees breaking or uprooting frequently is bad maintenance. \u201cMost trees in Bengaluru look healthy with a nice-looking canopy, but many die soon due to infections on the inside, it is the root that is weak or infected. The root health of the tree must be checked and maintained frequently to ensure the tree life sustains longer,\u201d Nishanth adds.\n\nThe Urban Forestry Handbook says Under India\u2019s National Forest Policy, 2018, which is aligned with COP21 climate action goals, India had declared that a third of the land area in India will be forested by 2030. Similarly, the Karnataka State Tree Cover Enhancement Policy of 2016 had set a goal of 33% land for state-wide tree cover, but in Bengaluru, there is no land-use based target for forestry. The book mentions research by Dr. T. V. Ramachandra and team at IISc that states that to ensure one tree per person and maintain some vital ecosystem services, Bengaluru must follow national and state goals, aiming to achieve 33% of urban forest cover in the city.\n\nWhat trees to choose\n\nExperts who have contributed to the book say that streets and public space availability for tree planting is low in Bengaluru. Choosing species with a tap root system or using a root barrier can help contain roots in a narrow space and push them deeper into the ground rather than wide. This ensures that roots can grow without disturbing surrounding buildings, roads, or footpaths, and the trunks grow upright as well, not obstructing road space. Selecting varieties with the correct height and without a wide crown can also help accommodate them in narrow spaces.\n\nNaturist and a regular conductor of tree walks, Kavya Chandra, the founder of A Green Venture, says planting of native trees with enough breathing space is more sustainable. \u201cThe unusual uprooting of trees during the pre-monsoon period is due to the roots weakening and not having enough space to grow. All trees need a circumference of 2 to 5 feet depending on the type, and regular care and maintenance. We need to understand the types of trees that will sustain the conditions of Bengaluru.\u201d\n\nAccording to Chandra, exotic trees like Gulmohar, Copper Pod, Tabebuia grow well in Bengaluru. Many of the ornamental trees that have been brought to the city from various countries have adapted to the conditions of Bengaluru over the last 200 years. \u201cNative trees like Pongamia (Honge), Bauhinia tree (Camel foot), the Muntinga Calabura tree (Singapore Cherry), Indian Almond tree (Jungli Badam) and smaller trees like neem, lime, curry leaf and guava will last longer, if they are given space and de-cemented around the base so the roots can breathe and don\u2019t get choked,\u201d says Chandra.",

        "text": "Two voice actors sued artificial-intelligence startup Lovo in Manhattan federal court on Thursday, accusing the company of illegally copying their voices and using them without permission in its AI voiceover technology.\n\nPaul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage said in the proposed class-action lawsuit that San Francisco-based Lovo is selling AI versions of their voices without permission after tricking them into providing voice samples for the company. The actors, seeking damages of at least $5 million for the class, accused Lovo of fraud, false advertising and violating their publicity rights.\n\nThe case is the latest in a growing wave of high-stakes lawsuits in which tech companies have been accused of misusing content including books, news articles and song lyrics to power generative AI systems.\n\n\"We want to make sure this doesn't happen to other people,\" lawyer Steve Cohen of Pollock Cohen, representing the plaintiffs, told Reuters. \"We don't know, of the thousands of voices Lovo says they use, how many people know that their voices were used and may still be used.\"\n\n(For top technology news of the day, subscribe to our tech newsletter Today\u2019s Cache)\n\nRepresentatives for Lovo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLehrman and Sage were approached on freelancer marketplace Fiverr to provide voiceover work for anonymous clients, according to the lawsuit. Lehrman was told his voice would be used only for a \"research project,\" while Sage was told her voice would be used only with \"test scripts for radio ads,\" the lawsuit stated.\n\nInstead, Lehrman later heard AI versions of his voice in YouTube videos about Russian military equipment and in a podcast episode about \"the dangers of AI technologies,\" according to the lawsuit. Sage's voice was used to give voiceovers for Lovo promotional materials, it added.\n\nLehrman later learned that his Fiverr client was a Lovo employee, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe actors said they later learned that Lovo was selling the use of Lehrman's voice to subscribers as \"Kyle Snow\" and Sage's as \"Sally Coleman.\" According to the complaint, the company responded to a cease-and-desist letter by saying the actors' voices were \"not popular\" and that their sales were \"negligible.\"\n\nThe actors filed the lawsuit on behalf of a proposed class of people whose voices Lovo also is accused of misusing. The complaint said Lovo's website also offers celebrity soundalike voices under names like \"Barack Yo Mama,\" \"Mark Zuckerpunch\" and \"Cocoon O'Brien.\"\n\nThe case is Lehrman v. Lovo Inc, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 1:24-cv-03770.",

        "title": "Can parties be de-recognised or de-registered? | Explained",
        "publish_date": "2024-05-17",
        "text": "The story so far: The Election Commission of India (ECI) in its report on enforcement of Model Code of Conduct (MCC) has stated that it expects star campaigners to lead by example and not vitiate the fabric of society. This has raised a debate about ECI powers to rein in MCC violations.\n\nWhat are registered parties?\n\nSection 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (RP Act) lays down the requirements for registration of a political party with the ECI. Any political party that seeks registration should submit a copy of its memorandum/constitution. Such document should declare that the party shall bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India. It should also bear allegiance to the principles of socialism, secularism and democracy, and uphold the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India. Registered political parties enjoy the following legal benefits \u2013 (a) tax exemption for donations received under Section 13A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, (b) common symbol for contesting general elections to the Lok Sabha/State Assemblies, and (c) twenty \u2018star campaigners\u2019 during election campaign. As per the ECI, there are 2,790 active registered political parties in India.\n\nWhat are recognised parties?\n\nA registered party is referred to as a Registered Unrecognised Political Party (RUPP). Political parties are recognised as a \u2018national\u2019 or \u2018State\u2019 party under the provisions of The Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968 (Symbols Order) by the ECI. The criteria for recognition at the \u2018national\u2019 or \u2018State\u2019 level consists of winning requisite number of seats and/or obtaining required percentage of votes in a general election to Lok Sabha or State Assembly. At present, there are six \u2018national\u2019 parties, and sixty-one \u2018State\u2019 parties that have been recognised. These recognised parties enjoy additional concessions of having a reserved symbol during elections and forty \u2018star campaigners\u2019.\n\nWhat are the issues?\n\nIt has been noticed that less than a third of RUPPs contest elections. The RP Act does not confer explicit powers on the ECI to de-register any political party if it fails to contest elections, conduct inner-party elections or lodge requisite returns. The Supreme Court in Indian National Congress versus Institute of Social Welfare & Ors (2002) had held that the ECI does not have power to de-register any political party under the RP Act. It may de-register only under exceptional circumstances like registration being obtained by fraud or the political party ceasing to have allegiance to the Constitution or if it is declared unlawful by the Government. The RUPPs that don\u2019t contest elections raise concerns over the possible misuse of income tax exemption and donations collected being used for money laundering.\n\nThe MCC prohibits using caste and communal feelings to secure votes, and bribing or intimidation of voters. Recognised political parties are guilty of violating the MCC on various occasions. However, it has been observed that the ECI on such occasions at best bars leaders from campaigning for a short period of two to three days.\n\nWhat needs to be done?\n\nThe ECI in its memorandum for electoral reforms (2016) has suggested amendment to the law that would empower the ECI to deregister a party. The Law Commission in its 255th report (2015) on \u2018Electoral reforms\u2019 has also recommended amendments for de-registration of a political party if it fails to contest elections for 10 consecutive years. These recommendations should be implemented. Under Paragraph 16A of the Symbols order, the ECI has the power to suspend or withdraw recognition of a recognised political party for its failure to observe MCC or follow lawful directions of the Commission. It has probably been used only once for three weeks in 2015 when the recognition of National People\u2019s Party was suspended for failure to follow the directions of the ECI. Strict action under this provision would have a salutary effect in ensuring adherence to the MCC.\n\nRangarajan R is a former IAS officer and author of \u2018Polity Simplified\u2019.

Both the pleas are listed before a Bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta.\n\nThe top Court on May 13 had refused interim bail to former Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren to campaign for the Lok Sabha polls but agreed to list his plea to quash his arrest by the ED in connection with a money laundering investigation linked to a land scam. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal appearing for Mr. Soren had emphasised the need for parity with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal who was granted interim bail to canvas votes in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections. One phase of polling has already been conducted in Jharkhand on May 13 while the remaining phases are set to take place on May 20, May 25 and June 1.\n\nThe central agency had arrested Mr. Soren under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) on January 31 after he submitted his resignation as the Chief Minister. He had been questioned for several hours at his official residence in Ranchi prior to his arrest.\n\nAlso Read: SC denies Soren\u2019s plea for interim bail, but agrees to hear his challenge to arrest by the ED on May 17\n\nWhile granting interim bail to the Delhi Chief Minister on May 10, the Supreme Court ordered him to surrender on June 2. The eight-page bail order had rejected the ED\u2019s contention that releasing Mr. Kejriwal on interim bail to campaign in the Lok Sabha polls would create an impression among the public, worse still, a judicial precedent, that politicians were a separate class, higher in status than the ordinary citizen and immune from arrest.\n\nIn the last hearing, the central agency apprised the Court that a complaint against Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is in the pipeline and there is direct evidence of its national convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal \u201cdemanding\u201d \u20b9100 crore as kickbacks in the liquor policy case.\n\nAlso Read: ED says Kejriwal sees himself as a special person, accuses him of remarks \u2018slapping the system\u2019\n\nThe Chief Minister had questioned the timing of his arrest on March 21, just days after the Model of Conduct came into force, arguing that it was politically motivated with the ED acting as a \u201ctool\u201d of the ruling party, BJP, at the Centre. Earlier on April 9, the Delhi High Court had upheld Mr. Kejriwal\u2019s arrest by recording a prima facie finding that there was adequate material, including statements of approvers, involvement of middlemen and references that cash was handed over for expenditure in the 2022 Goa elections.",

        "text": "Hundreds of military and armed police reinforcements deployed Friday to the riot-scarred streets of France's Pacific territory of New Caledonia, seeking to quell clashes that have left five people dead and hundreds injured.\n\nAnger over France's plan to impose new voting rules spiralled into the deadliest violence in four decades in the archipelago of 270,000 people, which lies between Australia and Fiji \u2014 17,000 kilometres (10,600 miles) from Paris.\n\nIn Paris, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said about 1,000 extra security forces were being sent to New Caledonia \u2014 adding to the 1,700 already present \u2014 while authorities would push for \"the harshest penalties for rioters and looters\".\n\nExtra forces began landing Thursday at the French army-controlled La Tontouta International Airport and could be seen moving through the capital Noumea in red berets, toting rifles, gas masks and riot shields.\n\nUsing state of emergency powers, security forces had imposed \"a calmer and more peaceful situation\" around Noumea for the first time since the unrest started on Monday, according to the high commission representing the French state.\n\nBut there were \"fires at a school and two companies\", it said in a statement Friday.\n\nSmouldering buildings\n\nOn Friday morning, AFP journalists saw flames and smoke pouring from a shopping centre, smouldering buildings, dozens of burned-out cars and residents dragging the remnants of vehicles off the roads.\n\nHundreds of people lined up outside shops for desperately needed food and supplies.\n\nThe security reinforcements will impose order \"where control is no longer assured\", High Commissioner of the Republic in New Caledonia Louis Le Franc told journalists in Noumea.\n\nSecurity forces have placed 10 independence activists accused of organising violence under house arrest, according to authorities.\n\nTwo gendarmes have been killed: one shot in the head and a second shot in friendly fire, officials said.\n\nThree other people \u2014 all Indigenous Kanaks \u2014 have also been killed: a 17-year-old and two men aged 20 and 36.\n\nBurning tyres\n\nOne person has been arrested on suspicion of killing two Kanaks, French authorities said. Another homicide suspect turned himself in on Friday, they said.\n\nAbout 200 among an estimated 5,000 \"rioters\" have been detained, officials said.\n\nGroups of Kanaks have set up roadblocks around the main island, waving the territory's flag, burning tyres and blocking or slowing traffic.\n\nOther mostly non-Indigenous residents, some armed, piled up garden chairs, crates and other belongings in neighbourhood barricades.\n\nThe violence is the worst seen in New Caledonia since violence involving independence radicals rocked the French overseas territory in the 1980s.\n\nTikTok has been banned in New Caledonia under the state of emergency because it was being used by the protesters, authorities said.\n\nThe social media giant called the decision \"regrettable\" in a statement and said that \"no request or question, no demand to withdraw content, had been made by local authorities or the French government\".\n\nBetween 80 and 90 percent of the grocery distribution network in Noumea \u2014 from shops to warehouses and wholesalers \u2014 has been \"wiped out\", Chamber of Commerce and Industry president David Guyenne said.\n\nThe chamber has said about 200 million euros of damage has been carried out.\n\nVoting rules\n\nWhile New Caledonia has on three occasions rejected independence in referendums, the cause retains strong support among the Kanak people, whose ancestors have lived on the islands for thousands of years.\n\nColonised by France from the second half of the 19th century, it has special status with some local powers that have been transferred from Paris.\n\nFrench lawmakers this week pushed forward plans to allow outsiders who moved to New Caledonia at least 10 years ago to vote in the territory's elections.\n\nPro-independence forces say that would dilute the vote of Kanaks, who make up about 40 percent of the population.\n\nVoting reform must still be approved by a joint sitting of both houses of the French parliament.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron has said French lawmakers will vote to adopt the constitutional change by the end of June unless New Caledonia's opposing sides can strike a new deal.\n\nBut a videoconference between Mr. Macron and New Caledonian lawmakers planned for Thursday was cancelled as \"the different players did not want to speak to one another\", his office said.",
