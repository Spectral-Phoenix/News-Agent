The party has risen too fast. They have started 'Operation Jhaadu' to crush the party. In the coming time, our bank accounts will be frozen and we will be brought on the road since our office will also be taken away,\" he said.\n\n\"There will be bigger challenges ahead. Please be ready to face them. Remember one thing we faced many challenges in the past. We have the blessings of Lord Hanuman and God. We would have not survived these. Walk on the path of truth. We want to work for the society,\" he told them.\n\nMr. Kejriwal, who is out on interim bail in the excise policy case, had said on Saturday that he and other AAP leaders would go to the BJP headquarters on May 19 \"so that the Prime Minister can send anyone he wishes to jail\".\n\n\"We will peacefully march to the BJP headquarters and if the police stop us, we will sit at that spot. We will wait for half an hour and see if they arrest us. If they do not arrest us, it will be their defeat. You can send us all in jail and see for yourself if the party ends or it rises more,\" he said.\n\nRecalling the period he was lodged in the Tihar Jail, Mr. Kejriwal said he read the Bhagavad Gita twice and the Ramayana once.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)",

According to statistics released by the Union Ministry of Coal for 2022-23, Tamil Nadu accounted for 49.97% of the production, followed by Gujarat at 27.37% ,and Rajasthan at 22.67%.\n\nNLC India Ltd., headquartered at Neyveli in Tamil Nadu, contributes a lion\u2019s share of lignite production. The public sector undertaking (PSU) lists, as among its performance highlights, the all-time high coal and lignite production of 36.32 tonnes in 2023-24 across the country.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu, the NLCIL\u2019s installed power generation capacity is 4,390 MW of thermal projects and 1,411 MW of renewable energy projects. Officials said some challenges in land acquisition had been overcome and that lignite production would be ramped up. However, much emphasis is also being laid on capacity addition through renewable energy sources.\n\n\u201cSustainability has been in all our actions, since inception,\u201d said Prasanna Kumar Motupalli, chairman and managing director, NLCIL. It was the first Central PSU to achieve 1 GW renewable energy capacity in India. The company has set as its target an installed capacity of 17.1 GW, including 6 GW renewable capacity, by 2030.\n\nThe environmental consequences of mining can be harsh. Green initiatives are being undertaken for the sustainable end use of land resources but more needs to be done on this aspect. At present, the focus is on scientific reclamation of mined lands. Going forward, there will be efforts to establish community-centric land uses such as restored forests and eco-parks, says the foreword to a report on \u201cGreening Initiatives in Coal and Lignite PSUs\u201d brought out by the Ministry of Coal.\n\nIn open cast mines, coal can be extracted only after removing layers of soil and stones.

        "text": "The Congress on May 19 claimed that the Modi Government's Forest Conservation Amendment Act had \"undid\" the progress of the historic Forest Rights Act of 2006 and accused the BJP of diluting tribal rights.\n\nCongress general secretary Jairam Ramesh posed questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of his rally in Jharkhand's Jamshedpur.\n\n\"Why do the people of Jamshedpur still suffer from poor connectivity? Why is it that the 2As and their tempo-loads of black money roam free, while Jharkhand's Adivasi CM was put in jail? Why is the Adityapur Industrial Area still waiting for environmental clearance? Why has the PM denied Adivasis their religious identity and refused to recognise the Sarna code?\" Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nElaborating on what he said were \"jumla details\", he said Jamshedpur, despite being an industrial hub, has poor transport connectivity.\n\nThe number of trains running to key cities such as Bhagalpur, Bengaluru, and Delhi are inadequate, he said.\n\nThe city had a functional airport until 2016 but despite being inducted into the UDAN scheme in 2018, plans for a new airport have failed to materialise, Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nIn January 2019, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Jharkhand Government and the Airports Authority of India for the construction of Dhalbhumgarh Airport by December 2022, he said.\n\n\"This would have been a massive boost to the industrial sector, from major players like Tata to the MSME sector in Adityapur. When the December 2022 deadline came and went, BJP's own MPs were compelled to raise the issue in Parliament. On February 27, 2023, the Union Civil Aviation Minister responded and confirmed that the project had been abandoned,\" Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nNow, after much hassle, environmental permission seems to have been granted, he said.\n\nWhy has the Modi Government neglected such essential infrastructure in Jharkhand, Mr. Ramesh asked.\n\n\"What happened to 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas'?\" he said.\n\n\"The outgoing PM's two best friends have been safe from the ED and CBI despite their tempos full of black money but Jharkhand's Adivasi Chief Minister was shamelessly thrown into jail. This is hardly surprising given how the Bhrasht Janata Party has sought to undermine Adivasi identity and dilute Adivasi rights,\" Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nLast year, the Modi Government passed the Forest Conservation Amendment Act which undid the progress of the historic Forest Rights Act of 2006 and scrapped provisions for the consent of local communities and other statutory requirements for forest clearance in vast areas, he said.\n\n\"The intention, of course, is to hand over access to the Prime Minister's best friends. Will the PM ever stop paying lip service to the slogan of Jal-Jangal-Zameen and meaningfully commit himself to Adivasi welfare?\" the Congress leader said.\n\n\u201cCan he shed some light on why the ED and CBI are yet to investigate his best friends\u2019 tempos?\u201d Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nHe further said that more than half of Jamshedpur's vital industrial hub \u2014 the Adityapur Industrial Area \u2014 has remained in regulatory limbo since 2015.\n\n\"This Special Economic Zone (SEZ) is home to 1,200 units, including 11 large-scale, 64 small-scale, and 166 tiny industries. In 2015, the Jharkhand State Industry Department provided clarifications regarding 54 acres of forest land within the 276-acre Special Economic Zone (SEZ) at the Adityapur Industrial Zone,\" Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nHowever, the Modi Government's delay in granting forest and environmental clearances have hindered development, he claimed.\n\n\"While this project has languished, the Modi Sarkar, in 2019, approved a Rs 14,000 crore SEZ project for Adani Power in Godda. Why is it that the Adityapur Industrial Area has waited almost 10 years, while Adani projects have been quickly pushed through? Was it during this deal that the outgoing PM saw the tempo-loads of black money that he told us about?\" Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nHe said for years, Jharkhand's tribal communities, followers of the Sarna faith, have sought official recognition of their distinct religious identity in India.\n\n\"However, the recent decision to remove the 'Others' option from the religion column in the census poses a dilemma for Sarna adherents, who must now choose between leaving the column blank or aligning themselves with specified religions,\" Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nIn November 2020, the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly passed a resolution endorsing this demand, he pointed out.\n\n\"Despite former BJP Chief Minister Raghubar Das's assurance of enacting the Sarna Code by 2021, and Home Minister Amit Shah promising the same in 2019, no progress has been made by the Modi Sarkar. As Prime Minister Modi visits Jharkhand, will he address this issue and clarify where he stands on enacting the Sarna Code? Were the promises made by Raghubar Das and Amit Shah mere jumlas?\" Mr. Ramesh said and asked the Prime Minister to break his \"silence\" on these issues.",

        "text": "Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' has exuded confidence that he would win the trust vote in the House of Representatives on Monday, days after a coalition partner withdrew its support for his government.\n\nMr. Prachanda, 69, a former guerilla leader, belongs to the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), the third largest party in the House of Representatives (HoR).\n\nHe will seek a vote of confidence in Parliament, the fourth within 18 months of taking office, amidst obstruction of the House proceedings by the Opposition Nepali Congress demanding a probe into the alleged involvement of Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane in the misappropriation of cooperative funds.\n\nAlso read: Nepal politics, past, present, and future\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that my government will survive the floor test,\u201d Prime Minister Prachanda said at a ruling party\u2019s programme in Kathmandu on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe differences between the ruling alliance and opposition parties will be sorted out through dialogue,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister is required to take a vote of confidence within 30 days if the party the Prime Minister is representing splits or if a member of the coalition government withdraws support. The Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) withdrew its support last week while quitting the coalition government.\n\nThis will be Prime Minister Prachanda's fourth vote of confidence within one and a half years after he assumed the top executive position on December 25, 2022.\n\nThe new government requires at least 138 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives to win the vote of trust.\n\nEarlier on March 13, Prime Minister Dahal won his third consecutive vote of confidence.\n\nLast year, Mr. Prachanda faced a floor test after former Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli-led CPN-UML withdrew its support to the Prachanda-led government following a rift over backing the main opposition party\u2019s candidate for the presidential poll.\n\nMr. Prachanda's support has notably declined in successive confidence votes. In January 2023, he obtained 268 votes, followed by 172 in March of the same year. His support further dwindled to just 157 votes in the third-floor test.\n\nCurrently, the ruling coalition holds a majority with 77 seats of the CPN-UML, 32 of the Maoist Centre, 21 of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, seven of the newly formed Janata Samajbadi Party and 10 seats of the CPN-Unified Socialist (CPN-US).\n\nMeanwhile, the major political parties have agreed to form a panel to look into the misappropriation of fund by cooperatives.",
